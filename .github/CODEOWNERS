# This document lists the code owners for all Linux repo sources, and it is
# used automatically whenever Pull Requests are created, in next way:
#  - People listed as CODEOWNERS are automatically added as reviewers to all
#    PRs open to branches containing this file.
#  - In addition to Code Owners, other reviewers can be added.
#  - There can be different code owners for different branches.
#  - PRs will require the approval of at least one code owner.
#
# For more details, you can refer [GitHub CodeOwners Documentation](ttps://github.blog/2017-07-06-introducing-code-owners/)
#
# The format of CODEOWNERS is: <pattern> + <mail address of one/more owners>
#
# In case of multiple matches, the last pattern matched will take precedence.

##### Global code owners (for folders with no later match) #####
