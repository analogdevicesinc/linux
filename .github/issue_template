Thank you for reporting an issue with us for this repository.

We typically recommend using our forum (EngineerZone) for reporting issues.
That is where you may also find some resolutions to some questions you may have.

The link is:
   https://ez.analog.com/linux-device-drivers/linux-software-drivers

You are still free to open an issue on Github, in case you prefer it here.
There are various other use-cases where this issue tracker is better suited than
the forum, such as punctual issues/items related to driver code, or keeping track
of certain tasks/items related to a particular driver changeset.

Thank you
Analog Devices, Inc. Linux Group
