Description:	The file holds the serial number of the client device obtained
		using a BHI (Boot Host Interface) register read after at least
		one attempt to power up the device has been done. If read
		without having the device power on at least once, the file will
		read all 0's.
Users:		Any userspace application or clients interested in device info.

What:           /sys/bus/mhi/devices/.../soc_reset
Date:           April 2022
KernelVersion:  5.19
Contact:        mhi@lists.linux.dev
Description:	Initiates a SoC reset on the MHI controller.  A SoC reset is
                a reset of last resort, and will require a complete re-init.
                This can be useful as a method of recovery if the device is
                non-responsive, or as a means of loading new firmware as a
                system administration task.

What:           /sys/bus/mhi/devices/.../trigger_edl
Date:           April 2024
KernelVersion:  6.10
Contact:        mhi@lists.linux.dev
Description:    Writing a non-zero value to this file will force devices to
                enter EDL (Emergency Download) mode. This entry only exists for
                devices capable of entering the EDL mode using the standard EDL
                triggering mechanism defined in the MHI spec v1.2. Once in EDL
                mode, the flash programmer image can be downloaded to the
                device to enter the flash programmer execution environment.
                This can be useful if user wants to use QDL (Qualcomm Download,
                which is used to download firmware over EDL) to update firmware.
