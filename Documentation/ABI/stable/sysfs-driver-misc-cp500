Description:	Flag which signals if FPGA shall keep or reload configuration
		bitstream on reset. Normal FPGA behavior and default is to keep
		configuration bitstream and to only reset the configured logic.

		Reloading configuration on reset enables an update of the
		configuration bitstream with a simple reboot. Otherwise it is
		necessary to power cycle the device to reload the new
		configuration bitstream.

		This file is read/write. The values are as follows:
		1 = keep configuration bitstream on reset, default
		0 = reload configuration bitstream on reset
