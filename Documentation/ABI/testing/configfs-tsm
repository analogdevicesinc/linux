Description:
		(RO) The value in this attribute increments each time @inblob or

		checking generation before writing to any attribute and making
		sure the number of writes matches expectations after reading
		@outblob, or it can prevent conflicts by creating a report

Description:
		(WO) Attribute is visible if a TSM implementation provider
		supports the concept of attestation reports from a service
		provider for TVMs, like SEV-SNP running under an SVSM.
		Specifying the service provider via this attribute will create
		an attestation report as specified by the service provider.
		The only currently supported service provider is "svsm".

		For the "svsm" service provider, see the Secure VM Service Module
		for SEV-SNP Guests v1.00 Section 7. For the doc, search for

		provider for TVMs, like SEV-SNP running under an SVSM.
		Specifying an empty/null GUID (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000)
		requests all active services within the service provider be
		part of the attestation report. Specifying a GUID request
		an attestation report of just the specified service using the
		manifest form specified by the service_manifest_version
		attribute.

		See 'service_provider' for information on the format of the
		service guid.

Description:
		(WO) Attribute is visible if a TSM implementation provider
		supports the concept of attestation reports from a service

		Indicates the service manifest version requested for the
		attestation report (default 0). If this field is not set by
		the user, the default manifest version of the service (the
