KernelVersion:	6.11
Contact:	linux-iio@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		List all the available test tones:
		- off
		- midscale_short
		- pos_fullscale
		- neg_fullscale
		- checkerboard
		- prbs23
		- prbs9
		- one_zero_toggle
		- user
		- bit_toggle
		- sync
		- one_bit_high
		- mixed_bit_frequency
		- ramp

		Note that depending on the actual device being used, some of the
		above might not be available (and they won't be listed when
		reading the file).

What:		/sys/kernel/debug/iio/iio:deviceX/in_voltageY_test_mode
KernelVersion:	6.11
Contact:	linux-iio@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		Writing to this file will initiate one of available test tone on
		channel Y. Reading it, shows which test is running. In cases
		where an IIO backend is available and supports the test tone,
		additional information about the data correctness is given.
