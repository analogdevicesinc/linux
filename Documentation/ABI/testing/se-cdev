Description:
		NXP offers multiple hardware IP(s) for  secure-enclaves like EdgeLock-
		Enclave(ELE), SECO. The character device file-descriptors
		/dev/<se>_mu*_ch* are the interface between user-space NXP's secure-
		enclave shared-library and the kernel driver.

		The ioctl(2)-based ABI is defined and documented in
		[include]<linux/firmware/imx/ele_mu_ioctl.h>
		 ioctl(s) are used primarily for:
			- shared memory management
			- allocation of I/O buffers
			- get mu info
			- setting a dev-ctx as receiver that is slave to fw

		The following file operations are supported:

		open(2)
		  Currently the only useful flags are O_RDWR.

		read(2)
		  Every read() from the opened character device context is waiting on
		  wakeup_intruptible, that gets set by the registered mailbox callback
		  function; indicating a message received from the firmware on message-
		  unit.

		write(2)
		  Every write() to the opened character device context needs to acquire
		  mailbox_lock, before sending message on to the message unit.

		close(2)
		  Stops and free up the I/O contexts that was associated
		  with the file descriptor.
