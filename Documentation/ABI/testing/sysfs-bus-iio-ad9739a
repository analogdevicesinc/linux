Description:
		DAC operating mode. One of the following modes can be selected:

		* normal: This is DAC normal mode.
		* mixed-mode: In this mode the output is effectively chopped at
			      the DAC sample rate. This has the effect of
			      reducing the power of the fundamental signal while
			      increasing the power of the images centered around
			      the DAC sample rate, thus improving the output
			      power of these images.
