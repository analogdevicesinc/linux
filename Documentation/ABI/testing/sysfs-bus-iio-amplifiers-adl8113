Description:
		This attribute allows the user to set the operation mode of the
		ADL8113 Low Noise Amplifier. The available modes control signal
		routing through different paths within the device.

		The supported modes are:

		* internal_amplifier - Signal passes through the internal low
		  noise amplifier (VA=0, VB=0). Provides 14dB gain.

		* internal_bypass - Signal bypasses through internal bypass path
		  (VA=1, VB=1). Provides 0dB gain.

		* external_bypass_a - Signal routes through external bypass path A
		  (VA=0, VB=1). Provides 0dB gain.

		* external_bypass_b - Signal routes through external bypass path B
		  (VA=1, VB=0). Provides 0dB gain.

Description:
		Reading this attribute returns a space-separated list of all
		available operation modes for the ADL8113 device. The modes
		control the signal path and determine whether the signal passes
		through the internal amplifier or various bypass paths.
