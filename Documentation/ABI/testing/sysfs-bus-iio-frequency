Description:
		Stores channel Y frequency resolution/channel spacing in Hz for PLL
		devices. The given value directly influences the operating mode when
		fractional-N synthesis is required, as it derives values for
		configurable modulus parameters used in the calculation of the output
		frequency. It is assumed that the algorithm that is used to compute
		the various dividers, is able to generate proper values for multiples
		of channel spacing.
