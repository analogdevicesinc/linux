Description:
                A write-only value indicating the Rate-of-Change FIR filter
                settings. This attribute selects the length of the Rate-of-
                Change FIR filter.

                Operation is not supported if Rate-of-Change detection of device
                is disabled.

Description:
                A read-only value indicating the slope calculated for a set of
                temperature measurements as programmed in in_temp_roc_filter
                attribute.

                Operation is not supported if Rate-of-Change detection of device
