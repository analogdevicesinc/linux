Description:
		It is a read/write file.
		Writing to this file causes the software to initiate a
		request to the firmware for doing requested scan operation in
		Configuration RAM (CRAM) or NPI of Versal mono/SSIT devices.
		User needs to provide scan operation id (init, start, stop) and
		SLR id (Versal SSIT device) details. For Versal mono devices,
		the SLR id should be 0.
		The scan operation id values are as given below:
		1 - Initialize the scan
		2 - Start CRAM scan
		3 - Stop CRAM scan
		5 - Start NPI scan
		6 - Stop NPI scan
		7 - Inject NPI error in first descriptor

		When read, it shows the current scan status with error code.
		The format is <0x1030 | operation Id> <error code> <Slr ID>
		The different error codes are as given below:
		==========	=====
		Error Code	Cause
		==========	=====
		0x0			Scan operation success
		0x1			Failure in NPI scan
		0x80		Calibration timeout
		0x2000		Internal error
		0x500000	CRAM initialization not yet done
		0x600000	Start scan failed
		0x700000	Stop scan failed
		0xF00000	Active CRC/UE error
		0x1000000	ECC/CRC error detected during calibration
