The mgb4 driver
===============

sysfs interface
---------------

The mgb4 driver provides a sysfs interface, that is used to configure video
stream related parameters (some of them must be set properly before the v4l2
device can be opened) and obtain the video device/stream status.

There are two types of parameters - global / PCI card related, found under
``/sys/class/video4linux/videoX/device`` and module specific found under
``/sys/class/video4linux/videoX``.

Global (PCI card) parameters

    Module type.

    | 0 - No module present
    | 1 - FPDL3

**fw_type** (R):
    Firmware type.

    | 1 - FPDL3
    | 2 - GMSL

**fw_version** (R):
    Firmware version number.

**serial_number** (R):
    Card serial number. The format is::

        PRODUCT-REVISION-SERIES-SERIAL

    VIDIOC_ENUMINPUT status bits.

    internal VSYNC pulse.

**hsync_gap_length** (RW):

    a valid frequency here.*

**hsync_width** (R):

    the vfrontporch field of the v4l2_bt_timings struct.

**frequency_range** (RW)
    PLL frequency range of the OLDI input clock generator. The PLL frequency is
    derived from the Pixel Clock Frequency (PCLK) and is equal to PCLK if

    "dual".

Common FPDL3/GMSL output parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**output_id** (R):
    Output number ID, zero based.

**video_source** (RW):
    Output video source. If set to 0 or 1, the source is the corresponding card
    input and the v4l2 output devices are disabled. If set to 2 or 3, the source

    *Note: This parameter can not be changed while ANY of the input/output v4l2
    devices is open.*

**display_width** (RW):
    Display width. There is no autodetection of the connected display, so the
    proper value must be set before the start of streaming. The default width
    is 1280.

    *Note: This parameter can not be changed while the output v4l2 device is
    open.*

**display_height** (RW):
    Display height. There is no autodetection of the connected display, so the
    proper value must be set before the start of streaming. The default height
    is 640.

    *Note: This parameter can not be changed while the output v4l2 device is
    open.*

**frame_rate** (RW):

    value and sets it. When reading this property, you get the exact

    *Note: This parameter can not be changed while the output v4l2 device is
    open.*

MTD partitions
--------------

The mgb4 driver creates a MTD device with two partitions:
 - mgb4-fw.X - FPGA firmware.
 - mgb4-data.X - Factory settings, e.g. card serial number.

The *mgb4-fw* partition is writable and is used for FW updates, *mgb4-data* is
read-only. The *X* attached to the partition name represents the card number.
Depending on the CONFIG_MTD_PARTITIONED_MASTER kernel configuration, you may
also have a third partition named *mgb4-flash* available in the system. This
partition represents the whole, unpartitioned, card's FLASH memory and one should
not fiddle with it...

IIO (triggers)
--------------

The mgb4 driver creates an Industrial I/O (IIO) device that provides trigger and
signal level status capability. The following scan elements are available:

**activity**:
	The trigger levels and pending status.

	| bit 1 - trigger 1 pending
	| bit 2 - trigger 2 pending
	| bit 5 - trigger 1 level
	| bit 6 - trigger 2 level

**timestamp**:
	The trigger event timestamp.

The iio device can operate either in "raw" mode where you can fetch the signal
levels (activity bits 5 and 6) using sysfs access or in triggered buffer mode.
In the triggered buffer mode you can follow the signal level changes (activity
bits 1 and 2) using the iio device in /dev. If you enable the timestamps, you
will also get the exact trigger event time that can be matched to a video frame
(every mgb4 video frame has a timestamp with the same clock source).

*Note: although the activity sample always contains all the status bits, it makes
no sense to get the pending bits in raw mode or the level bits in the triggered
buffer mode - the values do not represent valid data in such case.*
