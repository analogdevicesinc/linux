title: ARM CoreSight Mali Source integration

maintainers:

description: |
  See Documentation/trace/coresight/coresight.rst for detailed information
  about Coresight.

  This documentation will cover Mali specific devicetree integration.

  References to Sink ports are given as examples. Access to Sink is specific
  to an implementation and would require dedicated kernel modules.

  Arm Mali GPU are supporting 3 different sources: ITM, ETM, ELA

  ELA source configuration via SysFS entries:

    The register values used by CoreSight for ELA can be configured using SysFS
    interfaces. This implicitly includes configuring the ELA for independent or
    shared JCN request and response channels.
