title: Altera Cyclone V Fractional PLL

description: |
  Intel/Altera Cyclone V fPLL driver is recalculating the VCO
  settings each time a new channel's frequency is requested so
  the desired value can be actually obtained and is recalculating
  the dividers for the other channels to obtain the closest possible
  values to the previously set values.
