* NXP i.MX8QXP LPCG (Low-Power Clock Gating) Clock bindings

The Low-Power Clock Gate (LPCG) modules contain a local programming
model to control the clock gates for the peripherals. An LPCG module
is used to locally gate the clocks for the associated peripheral.

Note:
This level of clock gating is provided after the clocks are generated
by the SCU resources and clock controls. Thus even if the clock is
enabled by these control bits, it might still not be running based
on the base resource.

Required properties:
- compatible:		Should be one of:
			  "fsl,imx8qxp-lpcg"
			  "fsl,imx8qm-lpcg" followed by "fsl,imx8qxp-lpcg".
- reg:			Address and length of the register set.
- #clock-cells:		Should be 1. One LPCG supports multiple clocks.
- clocks:		Input parent clocks phandle array for each clock.
- bit-offset:		An integer array indicating the bit offset for each clock.
- hw-autogate:		Boolean array indicating whether supports HW autogate for
			each clock.
- clock-output-names:	Shall be the corresponding names of the outputs.
			NOTE this property must be specified in the same order
			as the clock bit-offset and hw-autogate property.
- power-domains:	Should contain the power domain used by this clock.

The clock consumer should specify the desired clock by having the clock
ID in its "clocks" phandle cell.

Examples:

#include <dt-bindings/clock/imx8qxp-clock.h>

sdhc0_lpcg: clock-controller@5b200000 {
	compatible = "fsl,imx8qxp-lpcg";
	reg = <0x5b200000 0x10000>;
	#clock-cells = <1>;
	clocks = <&sdhc0_clk IMX_SC_PM_CLK_PER>,
		 <&conn_ipg_clk>, <&conn_axi_clk>;
	bit-offset = <0 16 20>;
	clock-output-names = "sdhc0_lpcg_per_clk",
			     "sdhc0_lpcg_ipg_clk",
			     "sdhc0_lpcg_ahb_clk";
	power-domains = <&pd IMX_SC_R_SDHC_0>;
};

usdhc1: mmc@5b010000 {
	compatible = "fsl,imx8qxp-usdhc", "fsl,imx7d-usdhc";
	interrupt-parent = <&gic>;
	interrupts = <GIC_SPI 232 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	reg = <0x5b010000 0x10000>;
	clocks = <&sdhc0_lpcg 1>,
		 <&sdhc0_lpcg 0>,
		 <&sdhc0_lpcg 2>;
	clock-names = "ipg", "per", "ahb";
};
