* NXP S32V234 Clock Generation Modules (MC_CGMs)

The SoC supports four Clock Generation Modules, which provide registers for
system and peripherals clock source selection and division. See chapters 22
("Clocking"), 23 ("Clock Generation Module (MC_CGM)") and 69 ("Mode Entry
Module (MC_ME)") in the reference manual[1].

This binding uses the common clock binding:
    Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt

Required properties:
- compatible:
	Should be:
	- "fsl,s32v234-mc_cgm0" for MC_CGM_0
	- "fsl,s32v234-mc_cgm1" for MC_CGM_1
	- "fsl,s32v234-mc_cgm2" for MC_CGM_2
	- "fsl,s32v234-mc_cgm3" for MC_CGM_3
- reg:
	Location and length of the register set
- #clock-cells (only for MC_CGM_0):
	Should be <1>. See dt-bindings/clock/s32v234-clock.h for the clock
	specifiers allowed in the clocks property of consumers.

Example:
clks: mc_cgm0@4003c000 {
	compatible = "fsl,s32v234-mc_cgm0";
	reg = <0x0 0x4003C000 0x0 0x1000>;
	#clock-cells = <1>;
};
