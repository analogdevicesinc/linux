Legacy Freescale RA169Z20 adapter card for Seiko 43WVFIG panel, driver bindings

This is an adapter card made for the 4.3", 800x480, LCD panel Seiko 43WVFIG.
The LCD panel is a 24bit DPI bus, while the adapter card has two ports:
18-bit and 24-bit data input. For the 18-bit data input, the adapter card
is demuxing some of the data lines, in order to feed all of the 24 lines
needed by the LCD.

Required properties:
- compatible: 	"nxp,seiko-43wvfig"
- bus_mode:	must be one of <18> or <24>, depending on the input port
		used (18-bit or 24-bit)
- port:		input and output port nodes with endpoint definitions as
		defined in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/graph.txt;
		the input port should be connected to an lcd controller
		while the output port should be connected to the Seiko
		43wvfig LCD panel

Example:
	seiko_adapter: seiko-adapter {
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		compatible = "nxp,seiko-43wvfig";
		bus_mode = <18>;

		port@0 {
			reg = <0>;
			adapter_in: endpoint {
				remote-endpoint = <&lcdif_out>;
			};
		};
		port@1 {
			reg = <1>;
			adapter_out: endpoint {
				remote-endpoint = <&panel_in>;
			};
		};
	};
