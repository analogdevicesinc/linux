Samsung MIPI DSIM bridge bindings

The MIPI DSIM host controller drives the video signals from
display controller to video peripherals using DSI protocol.
This is an un-managed DSI bridge. In order to use this bridge,
an encoder or bridge must be implemented to manage the platform
specific initializations.

Required properties:
- compatible: 		"fsl,imx8mm-mipi-dsim"
- reg: 			the register range of the MIPI DSIM controller
- interrupts: 		the interrupt number for this module
- clock, clock-names: 	phandles to the MIPI-DSI clocks described in
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt
	"cfg"		- DSIM access clock
	"pll-ref"	- DSIM PHY PLL reference clock
	"pixel"		- DSIM input pixel clock, required only by i.MX8MP.
- assigned-clocks:	phandles to clocks that requires initial configuration
- assigned-clock-rates:	rates of the clocks that requires initial configuration
- pref-clk:		Assign DPHY PLL reference clock frequency. If not exists,
			DSIM bridge driver will use the default lock frequency
			which is 27MHz.
- port: 		input and output port nodes with endpoint definitions as
			defined in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/graph.txt;
			the input port should be connected to an encoder or a
			bridge that manages this MIPI DSIM host and the output
			port should be connected to a panel or a bridge input
			port

Optional properties:
-dsi-gpr:		a phandle which provides the MIPI DSIM control and gpr registers

example:
	mipi_dsi: mipi_dsi@32E10000 {
		compatible = "fsl,imx8mm-mipi-dsim";
		reg = <0x0 0x32e10000 0x0 0x400>;
		clocks = <&clk IMX8MM_CLK_DSI_CORE_DIV>,
			 <&clk IMX8MM_CLK_DSI_PHY_REF_DIV>;
		clock-names = "cfg", "pll-ref";
		assigned-clocks = <&clk IMX8MM_CLK_DSI_CORE_SRC>,
				  <&clk IMX8MM_CLK_DSI_PHY_REF_SRC>;
		assigned-clock-parents = <&clk IMX8MM_SYS_PLL1_266M>,
					 <&clk IMX8MM_VIDEO_PLL1_OUT>;
		assigned-clock-rates = <266000000>, <594000000>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 18 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		dsi-gpr = <&dispmix_gpr>;
		status = "disabled";

		port@0 {
			dsim_from_lcdif: endpoint {
				remote-endpoint = <&lcdif_to_dsim>;
			};
		};

		port@1 {
			dsim_to_adv7535: endpoint {
				remote-endpoint = <&adv7535_from_dsim>;
			};
		};

	};
