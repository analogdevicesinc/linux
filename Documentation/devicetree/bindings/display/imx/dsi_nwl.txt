NXP specific extensions to the Northwest Logic MIPI-DSI
================================

Platform specific extentions for the NWL MIPI-DSI host controller found in
MX8 platforms. This is an encoder/bridge that manages the platform specific
initializations required for the NWL MIPI-DSI host.

Required properties:
- compatible: 		"fsl,<chip>-mipi-dsi"
	The following strings are expected:
			"fsl,imx8qm-mipi-dsi"
			"fsl,imx8qxp-mipi-dsi"
- reg: 			the register range of the MIPI-DSI controller
- interrupts: 		the interrupt number for this module
- clock, clock-names: 	phandles to the MIPI-DSI clocks
	The following clocks are expected on all platforms:
		"phy_ref" - PHY_REF clock
		"tx_esc"  - TX_ESC clock (used in escape mode)
		"rx_esc"  - RX_ESC clock (used in escape mode)
	The following clocks are expected on i.MX8qm and i.MX8qxp:
		"bypass"  - bypass clock
		"pixel"   - pixel clock (for the pixel link)
- assigned-clocks:	phandles to clocks that requires initial configuration
- assigned-clock-rates:	rates of the clocks that requires initial configuration
	The following clocks needs to have an initial configuration:
	"tx_esc" and "rx_esc"
- port: 		input and output port nodes with endpoint definitions as
			defined in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/graph.txt;
			the input port should be connected to a display
			interface and the output port should be connected to a
			NWL MIPI-DSI host
- phys: 		phandle to the phy module representing the DPHY
			inside MIPI-DSI IP block
- phy-names: 		should be "dphy"

Optional properties:
- power-domains 	phandle to the power domain
- interrupt-parent 	phandle to the interrupt parent, if there is one;
			usually, on i.MX8qm and i.MX8qxp there is an irq
			steer handling the MIPI DSI interrupts
- csr 			phandle to the CSR register set (required on i.MX8qm
			and i.MX8qxp for the reset functions)
- assigned-clock-parents phandles to parent clocks that needs to be assigned as
			parents to clocks defined in assigned-clocks
- sync-pol		horizontal and vertical sync polarity of the input
			signal; can be <0> for LOW (negative) or <1> for HIGH
			(positive) polarity; default value is <0>, when this
			property is ommited

Example:
	mipi_dsi1: mipi_dsi {
		compatible = "fsl,imx8qxp-mipi-dsi";
		clocks =
			<&clk IMX8QXP_MIPI0_PIXEL_CLK>,
			<&clk IMX8QXP_MIPI0_BYPASS_CLK>,
			<&clk IMX8QXP_CLK_DUMMY>;
		clock-names = "pixel", "bypass", "phy_ref";
		power-domains = <&pd_mipi_dsi0>;
		csr = <&mipi_dsi_csr1>;
		phys = <&mipi_dsi_phy1>;
		phy-names = "dphy";
		status = "disabled";

		port@0 {
			mipi_dsi1_in: endpoint {
				remote-endpoint = <&dpu_disp0_mipi_dsi>;
			};
		};

		port@1 {
			mipi_dsi1_out: endpoint {
				remote-endpoint = <&mipi_dsi_bridge1_in>;
			};
		};
	};
