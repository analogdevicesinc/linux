description:
  The NXP's i.MX EdgeLock Enclave, a HW IP creating an embedded
  secure enclave within the SoC boundary to enable features like
  - HSM
  - SHE
  - V2X

  It uses message unit to communicate and coordinate to pass messages
  (e.g., data,  status and control) through its interfaces.

properties:
  compatible:
    enum:
      - fsl,imx8ulp-se-fw
      - fsl,imx93-se-fw
      - fsl,imx8dxl-se-fw

  mboxes:
    description:
      All MU channels must be within the same MU instance. Cross instances are
      not allowed. Users need to ensure that used MU instance does not conflict
      with other execution environments.

    description:
      Identifier to the message-unit among the multiple message-unit that exists on SoC.
      Per message-unit, multiple misc-devices are created, that are  used by userspace
      application as logical-waiter and logical-receiver.

    items:
      - description: Reserved memory region that can be accessed by firmware. Used for
          exchanging the buffers between driver and firmware.
