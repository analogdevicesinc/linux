  interrupts:
    description:
      The interrupt pins are digital outputs that can be configured at runtime
      as multiple interrupt signals. Each can be configured as GP_INTR, RDY,
      DEV_EN, logic low, logic high and DEV_RDY (GP1 only). RDY is the
      active-low data ready signal, indicates when new ADC data are ready to
      read. DEV_EN synchronizes the enable and power-down states of signal
      chain devices with the ADC sampling instant. DEV_RDY is an active-high
      signal that indicates when the device is ready to accept serial interface
      communications. In GP_INTR mode, the interrupt outputs one of the
      threshold detection interrupt signals (MIN_INTR, MAX_INTR or either).
    minItems: 1
    items:
      - description:
          gp0, interrupt line for GP0 pin, cannot be configured as DEV_RDY.
      - description:
          gp1, interrupt line for GP1 pin, can be configured to any setting.

  interrupt-names:
    items:
      - const: gp0

  gpio-controller:
    description:
      Marks the device node as a GPIO controller. GPs not listed in
      interrupt-names are exposed as a GPO.

  '#gpio-cells':
    const: 2
    description:
      The first cell is the GPIO number and the second cell specifies
      GPIO flags, as defined in <dt-bindings/gpio/gpio.h>.

  vdd-supply:
    description: Analog power supply.

  vio-supply:
    description: Digital interface logic power supply.

  ref-supply:
    description:
      Reference voltage to set the ADC full-scale range. If not present,
      vdd-supply is used as the reference voltage.
