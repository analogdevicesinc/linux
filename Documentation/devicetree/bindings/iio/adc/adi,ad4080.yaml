description: |
  The AD4080 is a high speed, low noise, low distortion, 20-bit, Easy Drive,
  successive approximation register (SAR) analog-to-digital converter (ADC).
  Maintaining high performance (SINAD > 90 dBFS) at signal frequencies up to
  5MHz, enables the AD4080 to service a wide variety of precision, wide
  bandwidth data acquisition applications. For applications that do not require
  the low result latency of the AD4080, simplification of the input anti-alias
  filter design can be accomplished with use of oversampling techniques using
  the integrated digital filtering to reduce both the input referred noise and
  output data rate
