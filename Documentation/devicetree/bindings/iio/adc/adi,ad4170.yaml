  avss-supply:
    description:

      bipolar power supply to AD4170-4. Must be −2.625V at minimum, 0V maximum.
      If not specified, this is assumed to be analog ground.

  avdd-supply:
    description:
      A supply of 4.75V to 5.25V relative to AVSS that powers the chip (AVDD).

  iovdd-supply:
    description: 1.7V to 5.25V reference supply to the serial interface (IOVDD).

  refin1p-supply:
    description: REFIN+ supply that can be used as reference for conversion.

  adi,gpio0-power-down-switch:
    type: boolean
    description:
      Describes whether GPIO0 is used as a switch to disconnect bridge circuits
      from AVSS. Pin defaults to GPIO if this property is not present.

  adi,gpio1-power-down-switch:
    type: boolean
    description:
      Describes whether GPIO1 is used as a switch to disconnect bridge circuits
      from AVSS. Pin defaults to GPIO if this property is not present.

  adi,vbias-pins:
    description: Analog inputs to apply a voltage bias of (AVDD − AVSS) / 2 to.

    maxItems: 9
    items:
      minimum: 0
      maximum: 8

  adi,dig-aux1:
    description:
      Describes whether DIG_AUX1 pin will operate as data ready output,
      synchronization output signal (SYNC_OUT), or if it will be disabled.
      0: DIG_AUX1 pin disabled. High impedance.
      1: Pin configured as ADC data ready output.
      2: Pin configured as SYNC_OUT output.
      If this property is absent, DIG_AUX1 pin is disabled.
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint8
    enum: [0, 1, 2]
    default: 0

  adi,dig-aux2:
    description:
      Describes whether DIG_AUX2 pin will function as DAC LDAC input,
      synchronization start input (START), or if it will be disabled.
      0: DIG_AUX2 pin disabled. High impedance.
      1: Pin configured as ADC data ready output.
      2: Pin configured as START input.
      If this property is absent, DIG_AUX2 pin is disabled.
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint8
    enum: [0, 1, 2]
    default: 0

  adi,sync-option:
    description:
      Describes how ADC conversions are going to be synchronized. A value of 1
      indicates the SYNC_IN pin will function as a synchronization input that
      allows the user to control the start of sampling by pulling SYNC_IN high.
      Use option number 2 to set the alternate synchronization functionality
      which allows per channel conversion start control when multiple channels
      are enabled. Option number 0 disables synchronization.
      0: No synchronization. SYNC_IN pin disabled.
      1: Standard synchronization functionality.
      2: Alternate synchronization functionality.
      If this property is absent, no synchronization is performed.

  "^channel@([0-9]|1[0-5])$":
    $ref: "adc.yaml"
    type: object
    description: |
      Represents the external channels which are connected to the ADC.

    properties:
      reg:
        description: |
          The channel number. The device can have up to 16 channels numbered
          from 0 to 15.
        items:
          minimum: 0
          maximum: 15

      adi,burnout-current-nanoamp:
        description: |
          Burnout current in nanoamps to be applied for this channel.
        enum: [0, 100, 2000, 10000]
        default: 0

      adi,chop-adc:
        description: |
          Specifies the chopping/swapping functionality for a channel setup.
          Macros for adi,chop-adc values are available in
          dt-bindings/iio/adi,ad4170.h. When enabled, the analog inputs are
          continuously swapped and a conversion is generated for each phase.
          The analog input pins are connected in one direction, sampled,
          swapped, sampled again, and then the conversion results are averaged.
          The input swapp minimizes system offset and offset drift.
          This property also specifies wheter AC excitation using 2 or 4 GPIOs
          are going to be used.
          0: No channel chop.
          1: Chop/swap the channel inputs.
          2: AC Excitation using 4 GPIOs.
          3: AC Excitation using 2 GPIOs.
          If this property is absent, no chopping is performed.
        $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint16
        enum: [0, 1, 2, 3]
        default: 0

      adi,reference-select:
        description: |
          Select the reference source to use when converting on
          the specific channel. Valid values are:
          0: Differential reference voltage REFIN+ - REFIN−.
          1: Differential reference voltage REFIN2+ - REFIN2−.
          2: Internal 2.5V referece (REFOUT) relative to AVSS.
          3: Analog supply voltage (AVDD) relative relative AVSS.
          If this field is left empty, the internal reference is selected.
