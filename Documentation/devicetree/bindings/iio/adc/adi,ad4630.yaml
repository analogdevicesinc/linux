  Analog Devices AD4630 Dual Channel Precision SAR ADC family

properties:

  adi,lane-mode:
    description:
    Change the number of SPI data lanes.

    one-lane-shared - In interleaved lane output data clocking mode, the
      Channel 0 and Channel 1 conversion data is interleaved on SDO0.
    one-lane-per-ch - 1-lane output data clocking mode is the default output
      data clocking mode at power-up.
    two-lanes-per-ch - When 2-lane output data clocking mode is enabled, the
      sample word bits are split between two SDO lanes.
    four-lanes-per-ch - When 4-lane output data clocking mode is enabled, the
      sample word bits are split between four SDO lane.
    enum: [one-lane-shared, one-lane-per-ch, two-lanes-per-ch, four-lanes-per-ch]

  adi,clock-mode:
    description:
      Change the master clock distribution mode. Echo clock mode and ADC
        master clock mode relax the timing requirements and simplify the
        use of digital isolators.

      spi-compatible - Normal SPI operation clocking
      echo-clock - Synchronous clock echoing to ease timing requirements
        when using isolation on the digital interface.
      clock-master - The ADC master clock mode uses an internal oscillator
        to clock out the data bits.
    enum: [spi-compatible, echo-clock, clock-master]

  adi,data-rate-mode:
    description:
      An optional dual data rate (DDR) data clocking can reduce the serial
        clock to 10 MHz while operating at a sample rate of 2 MSPS.

      single - Single data rate clocking (SDR) in which one bit (per active
        lane) is clocked out during a single clock cycle, is supported for all
        output configurations and sample formats.
      dual - DDR mode (two data bit transitions per clock cycle per active lane)
        is available only for master clock mode and echo clock mode
    enum: [single, dual]

  adi,out-data-mode:
    description:
    The device supports multiple sample formats.

      24diff - Sample is 24-bit differential voltage
      16diff-8com - Sample is composed of 16-bit differential voltage and 8-bit
        common voltage
      24diff-8com - Sample is composed of 24-bit differential voltage and 8-bit
        common voltage
      30diff-avg - Sample is 30-bit differential voltage averaged over previous
        samples
      32pat - Sample is a 32-bit test pattern
    enum: [24diff, 16diff-8com, 24diff-8com, 30diff-avg, 32pat]

  compatible:
    enum:
