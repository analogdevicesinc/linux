        description:
          The device address. On the same SPI lines there can connected up to 4
          devices, this is done by using the two address bits (ADDR0 and ADDR1).
          For mode details about this address look at page 27 of the datasheet
          at the Chip Addressing section.

      label:
        description:
          This label is used to recognize between the 4 ADAR1000 devices that
          can be supported on the same SPI lines. This is useful when trying to
          identify one device.

      adi,phasetable-name:
        description:
          The name specified here will be used by the device to load a custom
          phase table using the firmware load feature. The user can determine
          this values during the device calibration.
