          The device address. On the same SPI lines there can connected up to 16
          devices, this is done by using the four address bits
          (ADDR0, ADDR1, ADDR2 and ADDR3).
          For mode details about this address look at the datasheet at the Chip
          Addressing section.

      label:
        description:
          This label is used to recognize between the 16 ADAR300x devices that
          can be supported on the same SPI lines. This is useful when trying to
          identify one device.
