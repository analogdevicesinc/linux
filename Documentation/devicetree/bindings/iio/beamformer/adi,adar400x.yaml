description: |
  The ADAR4000 and ADAR4001 are wideband beamformer ICs operating from 2 GHz to
  18 GHz, designed for transmit and receive phased array applications,
  respectively. Both feature a true time delay core for beam-squint free
  operation, with configurable delays up to 508 ps and fine resolution down to
  2 ps. Each path includes a 31.5 dB digital step attenuator with 0.5 dB steps.
  They support SPI control for up to 16 devices and include on-chip RAM and
  FIFO for storing and sequencing beamstates.
