title: ADMV8818 Digitally Tunable, High-Pass and Low-Pass Filter

maintainers:
  - Antoniu Miclaus <antoniu.miclaus@analog.com>

description: |
    Fully monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC) that
    features a digitally selectable frequency of operation.
    The device features four independently controlled high-pass
    filters (HPFs) and four independently controlled low-pass filters
    (LPFs) that span the 2 GHz to 18 GHz frequency range.

  clock-scales:
    description:
      The Common Clock Framework max rate is limited by MAX of unsigned long.
      For ADMV8818 device this is a deficiency. If specified, this
      property allows arbitrary scales. The first element in the array should
      be the multiplier and the second element should be the divider.

  adi,bw-hz:
    description:
      Allows the user to increase the Bandpass Filter (BPF) bandwidth
      in Hz. Normally when invoked by the clk notifier, the driver
      sets the HPF cutoff close below the frequency and the LPF cutoff
      close above the frequency, and thus creating a BPF.
