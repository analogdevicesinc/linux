* Analog Devices ADF4360 PLL

The ADF4360 devices are a family of PLLs with integrated VCO and integer-N frequency
synthesizer. Each of the parts in the family has a specific frequency range that
is supported by its respective internal VCO.

The device has a reference clock input and a clock output that has the generated
frequency.

An external loop filter is required on the PCB to control the loop of the
phase-frequency-detector of the PLL. The charge pump current and the
phase-frequency-detector frequency need to be configured according to the
requirements for which the external loop filter was designed.

The device offers a write-only SPI interface to configure it.

The devicetree bindings for this device follow the standard bindings for SPI
devices (../spi/spi.txt) and clock consumers and providers (clock-bindings.txt).

Required properties:

- compatible: must be one of
    * adi,adf4360-0
    * adi,adf4360-1
    * adi,adf4360-2
    * adi,adf4360-3
    * adi,adf4360-4
    * adi,adf4360-5
    * adi,adf4360-6
    * adi,adf4360-7
    * adi,adf4360-8
    * adi,adf4360-9
- reg: SPI chip select number for the device
- spi-max-frequency: Max SPI frequency to use (< 20000000)
- #clock-cells: Must should be 0.
- clock-output-names:
- clocks: Phandle and optional specifier to clock node that describes the
    reference input clock

- adi,loop-filter-pfd-frequency-hz: The frequency of the
    phase-frequency-detector that the external loop filter was designed for.
- adi,loop-filter-charger-pump-current: The charge pump current that the
    external loop filter was designed for.

Optional properties:
- adi,loop-filter-inverting: Indicates that the external loop filter is a
    inverting filter.

Required properties for ADF4360-7, ADF4360-8 and ADF4360-9:
  ADF4360-7 to ADF4360-9 have a VCO that is tuned to a specific frequency range
  using an external inductor placed on the PCB. These properties describe the
  range selected by the external inductor.

- adi,vco-minimum-frequency-hz: Minimum VCO frequency that can be supported by
    the tuning range set by the external inductor.
- adi,vco-maximum-frequency-hz: Maximum VCO frequency that can be supported by
    the tuning range set by the external inductor.

Example:

&spi {
	pll@0 {
		compatible = "adi,adf4360-7";
		reg = <0>;
		spi-max-frequency = <2000000>;

		#clock-cells = <0>;
		clock-output-names = "adf4360-7";

		clocks = <&ref_clock>;

		adi,loop-filter-charge-pump-current = <5>;
		adi,loop-filter-pfd-frequency-hz = <2500000>;
		adi,vco-minimum-frequency-hz = <700000000>;
		adi,vco-maximum-frequency-hz = <840000000>;
	};
};
