    description:
      The Common Clock Framework max rate is limited by MAX of unsigned long.
      For ADF4371/ADF4372 devices this is a deficiency. If specified, this
      property allows arbitrary scales. The first element in the array should
      be the multiplier and the second element should be the divider.

  adi,mute-till-lock-en:
    description:
      If this property is present, then the supply current to RF8P and RF8N
      output stage will shut down until the ADF4371/ADF4372 achieves lock as
      measured by the digital lock detect circuitry.

  adi,charge-pump-microamp:
    description:
      Sets the charge pump current. If this property is not specified, then the
      charge pump current is set to the default 1750uA. The valid values are
      listed below. However, if the set value is not supported, the driver will
      look for the closest valid charge pump current.

    description: Represents the external channels which are connected to the device.

    properties:
      reg:
        description: |
          The channel number. It can have up to 3 channels on adf4372
          and 4 channels on adf4371, numbered from 0 to 3.

      adi,output-enable:
        description: |
          If this property is specified, the output channel will be enabled.
          If left empty, the driver will initialize the defaults (RF8x, channel 0
          will be the only one enabled).
        maxItems: 1

      adi,power-up-frequency:
        description: |
          Set the frequency after power up for the channel. If this property is
          specified, it has to be in sync with the power up frequency set on the
          other channels. This limitation is due to the fact that all the channel
          frequencies are derived from the VCO fundamental frequency.
