      If this property is present, then the supply current to RF8P and RF8N
      output stage will shut down until the ADF4371/ADF4372 achieves lock as
      measured by the digital lock detect circuitry.

    description: Represents the external channels which are connected to the device.

    properties:
      reg:
        description: |
          The channel number. It can have up to 3 channels on adf4372
          and 4 channels on adf4371, numbered from 0 to 3.
        maxItems: 1

      adi,output-enable:
        description: |
          If this property is specified, the output channel will be enabled.
          If left empty, the driver will initialize the defaults (RF8x, channel 0
          will be the only one enabled).
        maxItems: 1

      adi,power-up-frequency:
        description: |
          Set the frequency after power up for the channel. If this property is
          specified, it has to be in sync with the power up frequency set on the
          other channels. This limitation is due to the fact that all the channel
          frequencies are derived from the VCO fundamental frequency.
