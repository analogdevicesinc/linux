  adi,vco-frequency-hz:
    description: |
      VCO input frequency. This is fed to the internal distribution path and
      feedback dividers.

  adi,ref-frequency-hz:
    description: |
      Reference input frequency. This is fed in the reference divider.

  adi,pulse-generator-mode:

      Select the pulse generator mode. Valid values are:
      0: One Pulse
      1: Two Pulses
      2: Four Pulses
      3: Eight Pulses
      If this field is left empty, One Pulse is selected.

    description:
      If this property is present, LTC6952 will be in follower mode
      similar to LTC6953.

  adi,sync-via-ezs-srq-enable:
    type: boolean
    description:
      If this property is present, the device will use EZS_SRQ Synchronization
      or SYSREF Request Input.

  adi,input-buffer-filt-enable:
    type: boolean
    description:
      If this property is present, the reference input bufferâ€™s low-pass filter
      will be enabled. Enabling this LPF is recommended for
      sine wave signals < 20 MHz.
