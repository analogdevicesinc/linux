Analog Devices JESD204B Receive Peripheral Driver

The AXI JESD204B RX peripheral driver is a simple driver that supports the
ADI JESD204B Receive Peripheral. The driver reads JESD204B link configuration
data from the devicetree and configures the peripheral accordingly. After
configuration has completed the JESD204B link is enabled. Link state can be
monitored through sysfs files.

Required properties:
  - compatible: Must always "adi,axi-jesd204-rx-1.0".
  - reg: Base address and register area size. This parameter expects a register
         range.
  - interrupts: Property with a value describing the interrupt number.
  - clock-names: List of input clock names - “s_axi_aclk”, “device_clk”
  - clocks: Clock phandles and specifiers (See clock bindings for details on
            clock-names and clocks).
  - adi,frames-per-multiframe: Number of frames per multi-frame (K).
  - adi,octets-per-frame: Number of octets per frame (N).

Optional properties:
  - adi,high-density: If specified the JESD204B link is configured for high
                      density (HD) operation.

Example:

jesd204b-rx@77b00000 {
	compatible = "adi,axi-jesd204-rx-1.0";
	reg = <0x77b00000 0x10000>;
	interrupts = <0 56 4>;

	clock-names = "s_axi_aclk", "device_clk";
	clocks = <&clkc 14>, <&ad9528 13>;

	adi,octets-per-frame = <32>;
	adi,frames-per-multiframe = <4>;
};
