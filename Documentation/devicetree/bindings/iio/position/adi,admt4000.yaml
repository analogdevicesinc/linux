description: |
  The ADMT4000 is a magnetic turn count sensor capable of recording the number
  of rotations of a magnetic system even while the device is powered down. On
  power-up, the device can be interrogated to report the absolute position of
  the system. Datasheet can be found here:
  https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/admt4000.pdf
