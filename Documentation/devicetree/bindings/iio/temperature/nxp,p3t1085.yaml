  P3T1085UK is a temperature-to-digital converter with a -40 °C
  to +125 °C range. The device can be communicated by a controller
  via the 2-wire serial I3C (up to 12.5 MHz) and I2C (up to 3.4 MHz)
  interface.

  The I2C interface supports up to four target addresses and an
  alert function which becomes active when the temperature exceeds
  the programmed limits.

  The I3C interface supports IBI (In Band Interrupt) where P3T1085UK
  emits its address into the arbitrated address header on the I3C bus
  to notify the controller of an interrupt. It does not require an
  additional interrupt pin.

  P3T1085UK can be configured for different operation conditions.
  It can be set in normal mode to periodically monitor the ambient
  temperature, or in shut-down mode to minimize power consumption.
  The temperature register always stores a 12 bit two's complement
  data, giving a temperature resolution of 0.0625 °C
