title: Arducam Pivariety Series CMOS Digital Image Sensor

maintainers:

description: |-
  Arducam Pivariety series cameras make compatibility layers for various CMOS
  sensors and provide a unified command interface. It is programmable through
  I2C interface. The I2C address is fixed to 0x0C. Image data is sent through
  MIPI CSI-2, which is configured as either 1, 2 or 4 data lanes.
