      A pipe can carry multiple video streams with each stream having
      different virtual channels and data types.

      A pipe operates in one of the following modes:
       - Mode 1: Streams with the same bpp of up to 24 bpp.
       - Mode 2: Streams with 16, 14, 12, 10, 8 bpp, with streams less than
                 16 bpp being zero-padded.
       - Mode 3: Streams with two different bpp rates, one being double
                 the other, with the highest possible bpp being 24.
      Only modes 1 and 3 carry data at full bandwidth.

      Each pipe receives data from one link.

      Each pipe outputs data to a PHY, and multiple pipes can output data
      to the same PHY.
