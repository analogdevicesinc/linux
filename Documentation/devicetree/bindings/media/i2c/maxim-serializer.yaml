      A pipe can carry multiple video streams with each stream having
      different virtual channels and data types.

      A pipe operates in one of the following modes:
       - Mode 1: Streams with the same bpp of up to 24 bpp.
       - Mode 2: Streams with 16, 14, 12, 10, 8 bpp, with streams less than
                 16 bpp being zero-padded.
       - Mode 3: Streams with two different bpp rates, one being double
                 the other, with the highest possible bpp being 24.
      Only modes 1 and 3 carry data at full bandwidth.

      Each pipe receives data from a PHY, and multiple pipes can receive data
      from the same PHY.

        description: |
          The PHY id from which this pipe will receive its data.
          The default PHY id will depend on the number of pipes and PHYs.
          Eg: on a device with 4 pipes and 2 PHYs, pipe 0 and 1 will
          receive data from PHY 0, while pipes 2 and 3 will receive data
          from PHY 1.

          The stream id which the pipe will use to transmit its frames.
          On the deserializer side, each pipe will also have a stream id
          which it will use to filter the frames.
          Multiple pipes cannot use the same stream id.
          The default stream id is the same as the pipe id.
