NXP Image Sensor Interface
========================

The Image Sensor Interface (ISI) is used to obtain the image data for
processing in its pipeline channels. Each pipeline processes the image
line from a configured source and performs one or more functions that
are configured by software, such as down scaling, color space conversion,
de-interlacing, alpha insertion, cropping and rotation (horizontal and
vertical). The processed image is stored into programmable memory locations.

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "fsl,imx8-isi", where SoC can be one of imx8qxp, imx8qm
- reg: the register base and size for the device registers
- interrupts: the ISI interrupt, high level active
- clock-names: should be "per"
- clocks: the ISI AXI clock
- interface: specify ISI input, virtual channel and output,
             <Input MIPI_VCx Output>
             Input : 0-DC0, 1-DC1, 2-MIPI CSI0, 3-MIPI CSI1, 4-HDMI, 5-MEM
	     VCx   : 0-VC0, 1-VC1, 2-VC2, 3-VC3, MIPI CSI only
	     Output: 0-DC0, 1-DC1, 2-MEM

Example:
        isi_0: isi@58100000 {
                compatible = "fsl,imx8-isi";
                reg = <0x58100000 0x10000>;
                interrupts = <GIC_SPI 297 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
                interrupt-parent = <&gic>;
                clocks = <&img_lpcg IMX_IMG_LPCG_PDMA0_CLK>;
                clock-names = "per";
                power-domains = <&pd IMX_SC_R_ISI_CH0>;
                interface = <2 0 2>;
        };
