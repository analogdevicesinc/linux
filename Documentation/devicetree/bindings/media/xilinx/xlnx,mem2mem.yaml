description:
  Xilinx video IP mem2mem pipeline processes DMA transfers to achieve memory
  copy from one physical memory to other. The data is copied by employing two
  DMA transfers memory to device and device to memory transactions one after
  the other. The DT node of the XVIM2M represents as a top level node of the
  pipeline and defines mappings between DMAs.
