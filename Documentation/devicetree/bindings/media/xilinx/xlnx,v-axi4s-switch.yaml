description:
  The AXI4-Stream Switch provides configurable routing between masters and slaves.
  It supports up to 16 masters/sources and 16 slaves/sinks and two routing options.
  There is at least one slave/sink port and two master/source ports.
  The two routing options available are TDEST routing and control register routing.
  The TDEST based routing uses design parameters and hence there no software control.
  Each port is mapped as a pad and has its own format specified.
  Control register routing introduces an AXI4-Lite interface to configure the
  routing table. There is one register for each of the master interfaces to
  control each of the selectors. This routing mode requires that there is
  precisely only one path between master and slave. When attempting to map the
  same slave interface to multiple master interfaces, only the lowest master
  interface is able to access the slave interface.
  Here only the slave/sink ports have formats as master/source ports will inherit
  the corresponding slave ports formats. A routing table is maintained in this case.
  Please refer to PG085 AXI4-Stream Infrastructure IP Suite v2.2 for more details.
