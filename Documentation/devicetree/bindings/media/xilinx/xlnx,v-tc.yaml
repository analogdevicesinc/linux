description:
  The Xilinx Video Timing Controller core is a general purpose video
  timing generator and detector. The core is highly programmable
  through a comprehensive register set allowing control of various
  timing generation parameters. This programmability is coupled with
  a comprehensive set of interrupt bits which provides easy integration
  into a processor system for in-system control of the block in
  real-time. The Video Timing Controller is provided with an optional
  AXI4-Lite compliant interface.
  For more details refer to PG 016 Xilinx Video Timing Controller.
