  poweroff-gpios:
    description:
      This property sets the GPIO as output. Then used to control the power and
      mode state of the device. This can be enabled optionally to control the
      state of comparators in the voltage monitoring and/or trigger timestamp
      recording in the flexible power sequence recording functions. Check the
      state transition conditions in datasheet for more information.
