  adi,transfer-length:
    description: |
      In cases where the data source does not indicate packet boundaries, which will usually be
      the case with RX streams coming from an ADC, transfer-length can be used to override the
      default behavior of completely filling up the datastore before any output is produced.
      A value of zero indicates that all available storage should be used. Values MUST be
      divisble by 64!
      Unit is bytes

    default: 0
    minimum: 0
    maximum: 4294967296


  adi,sync-config:
    description: |
      The synchronization mode determines which triggering mechanism will be used. For the RX
      path the trigger determines when the input side will start accepting samples, while for
      a TX configuration the offload engine will always store (until full), but only forward once
      triggered. Supported modes are: Automatic (0), Hardware triggering (1), Software
      triggering (2).
      Note, for hardware that includes a TDD engine that is controlled by a kernel driver, this
      value may also be overridden by the driver.
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32
    enum: [0, 1, 2]
    default: 0

  adi,bringup:
    description: |
      If this property is present, the resetn register will be forced high. In most cases this
      will be inconsequential, because the default value of the AUTO_BRINGUP synthesis parameter
      will have the same effect, thus only if you are running a custom hardware configuration
      that does not automatically come out of reset, should this option be used.
    type: boolean

  adi,bypass:
    description: |
      Sets the data_offload to bypass mode, effectively turning it into a small AXIS CDC fifo.
      This option will be overridden by the cf_axi_dds driver, and therefore should only be used
      in hardware configurations where that driver is not used to control the dma and data offload.
    type: boolean

  adi,oneshot:
    description: |
      Sets the data_offload to oneshot mode, while the default behavior would be cyclic operation.
      Like adi,bypass, in most hardware configurations this value will also be overridden by
      other drivers at runtime.
