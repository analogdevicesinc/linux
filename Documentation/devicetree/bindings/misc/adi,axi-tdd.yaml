description: |
  The TDD controller is a waveform generator capable of addressing RF
  applications which require Time Division Duplexing, as well as controlling
  other modules of general applications through its dedicated 32 channel
  outputs. It solves the synchronization issue when transmitting and receiving
  multiple frames of data through multiple buffers.
  The TDD IP core is part of the Analog Devices hdl reference designs and has
  the following features:
    * Up to 32 independent output channels
    * Start/stop time values per channel
    * Enable and polarity bit values per channel
    * 32 bit-max internal reference counter
    * Initial startup delay before waveform generation
    * Configurable frame length and number of frames per burst
    * 3 sources of synchronization: external, internal and software generated
