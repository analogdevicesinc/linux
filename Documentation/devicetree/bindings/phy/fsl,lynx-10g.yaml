title: Freescale Lynx 10G SerDes PHY

description:
  The Lynx 10G is a multi-protocol SerDes block which handles networking, PCIe,
  SATA, USB and other high-speed interfaces. It is present on most QorIQ and
  Layerscape SoCs. The integration is SoC-specific, with the differences
  consisting in register endianness, the number of lanes, protocol converters
  available per lane and their location in the PCCR registers. Some SoCs have
  multiple SerDes blocks and even those differ in their protocol configuration.

    description:
      Encodes lane number from consumer's perspective (lane A corresponds to 0).
      This number corresponds to the lane as visible in the SerDes IP's
      registers (such as LNaPSSR0), and this may not be necessarily identical
      to the lane numbering scheme from the SoC's pinout.

  fsl,dcfg-handle:
    description:
      Should be a phandle to the DCFG block of the SoC. On some SoC
      integrations, major reconfiguration of the networking SerDes protocol
      requires an RCW override procedure, which is handled by the DCFG.
      The RCW override procedure requires hardware validation for each SoC and
      is currently not implemented.
