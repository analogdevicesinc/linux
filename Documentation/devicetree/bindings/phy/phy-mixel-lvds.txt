Mixel LVDS PHY

This LVDS PHY supports two LVDS channels.

Required properties:
- compatible: must be "mixel,lvds-phy".
- reg: offset and length of the register block.
- #address-cells: number of address cells for the LVDS channel subnodes, must
		  be <1>.
- #size-cells: number of size cells for the LVDS channel subnodes, must be <0>.
- clocks: clock phandle and specifier pair.
- clock-names: string, clock input name, must be "phy".
- power-domains: phandle pointing to power domain.

The LVDS PHY device tree node should have the subnodes corresponding to the two
LVDS channels. These subnodes must contain the following properties:
- reg: the PHY ID.
- #phy-cells: see phy-bindings.txt in the same directory, must be <0>.

Example:
	ldb_phy@56241000 {
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		compatible = "mixel,lvds-phy";
		reg = <0x0 0x56241000 0x0 0x100>;
		clocks = <&clk IMX_LVDS0_PHY_CLK>;
		clock-names = "phy";
		power-domains = <&pd IMX_SC_R_LVDS_0>;

		ldb1_phy1: port@0 {
			reg = <0>;
			#phy-cells = <0>;
		};

		ldb1_phy2: port@1 {
			reg = <1>;
			#phy-cells = <0>;
		};
	};
