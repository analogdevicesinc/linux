Device Tree Bindings for Freescale i.MX8M Generic Power Domain
==============================================================
The binding for the i.MX8M Generic power Domain[1].

[1] Documentation/devicetree/bindings/power/power_domain.txt

Required properties:

 - compatible: should be of:
	- "fsl,imx8m-power-domain"
 - #power-domain-cells: Number of cells in a PM domain Specifier, must be 0
 - domain-index: should be the domain index number need to pass to TF-A
 - domain-name: the name of this pm domain

Optional properties:
 - clocks: a number of phandles to clocks that need to be enabled during
   domain power-up sequence to ensure reset propagation into devices
   located inside this power domain
 - power-supply: Power supply used to power the domain
 - parent-domains: the phandle to the parent power domain

example:
	vpu_g1_pd: vpug1-pd {
		compatible = "fsl,imx8mm-pm-domain";
		#power-domain-cells = <0>;
		domain-index = <6>;
		domain-name = "vpu_g1";
		parent-domains = <&vpumix_pd>;
		clocks = <&clk IMX8MM_CLK_VPU_G1_ROOT>;
	};


Specifying Power domain for IP modules
======================================

IP cores belonging to a power domain should contain a 'power-domains'
property that is a phandle for PGC node representing the domain.

Example of a device that is part of the vpu_g1 power domain:
	vpu_g1: vpu_g1@38300000 {
		/* ... */
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 7 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		interrupt-names = "irq_hantro";
		/* ... */
		power-domains = <&vpu_g1_pd>;
	};
