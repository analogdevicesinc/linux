* Power Management Controller

Properties:
- compatible: "fsl,<chip>-pmc".

  "fsl,mpc8349-pmc" should be listed for any chip whose PMC is
  compatible.  "fsl,mpc8313-pmc" should also be listed for any chip
  whose PMC is compatible, and implies deep-sleep capability.

  "fsl,mpc8548-pmc" should be listed for any chip whose PMC is
  compatible.  "fsl,mpc8536-pmc" should also be listed for any chip
  whose PMC is compatible, and implies deep-sleep capability and
  wake on user defined packet(wakeup on ARP).

  "fsl,p1022-pmc" should be listed for any chip whose PMC is
  compatible, and implies lossless Ethernet capability during sleep.

  "fsl,mpc8641d-pmc" should be listed for any chip whose PMC is
  compatible; all statements below that apply to "fsl,mpc8548-pmc" also
  apply to "fsl,mpc8641d-pmc".

  Compatibility does not include bit assignments in SCCR/PMCDR/DEVDISR; these
  bit assignments are indicated via the clock nodes.  Device which has a
  controllable clock source should have a "fsl,pmc-handle" property pointing
  to the clock node.

- reg: For devices compatible with "fsl,mpc8349-pmc", the first resource
  is the PMC block, and the second resource is the Clock Configuration
  block.

  For devices compatible with "fsl,mpc8548-pmc", the first resource
  is a 32-byte block beginning with DEVDISR.

- interrupts: For "fsl,mpc8349-pmc"-compatible devices, the first
  resource is the PMC block interrupt.

- fsl,mpc8313-wakeup-timer: For "fsl,mpc8313-pmc"-compatible devices,
  this is a phandle to an "fsl,gtm" node on which timer 4 can be used as
  a wakeup source from deep sleep.

Clock nodes:
The clock nodes are to describe the masks in PM controller registers for each
soc clock.
- fsl,pmcdr-mask: For "fsl,mpc8548-pmc"-compatible devices, the mask will be
  ORed into PMCDR before suspend if the device using this clock is the wake-up
  source and need to be running during low power mode; clear the mask if
  otherwise.

- fsl,sccr-mask: For "fsl,mpc8349-pmc"-compatible devices, the corresponding
  bit specified by the mask in SCCR will be saved and cleared on suspend, and
  restored on resume.

- fsl,devdisr-mask: Contain one or two cells, depending on the availability of
  DEVDISR2 register.  For compatible devices, the mask will be ORed into DEVDISR
  or DEVDISR2 when the clock should be permenently disabled.

Example:

	power@e0070 {
		compatible = "fsl,mpc8536-pmc", "fsl,mpc8548-pmc";
		reg = <0xe0070 0x20>;

		etsec1_clk: soc-clk@24 {
			fsl,pmcdr-mask = <0x00000080>;
		};
		etsec2_clk: soc-clk@25 {
			fsl,pmcdr-mask = <0x00000040>;
		};
		etsec3_clk: soc-clk@26 {
			fsl,pmcdr-mask = <0x00000020>;
		};
	};
