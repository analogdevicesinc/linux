title: NXP i.MX PWM over RPMSG driver

description: |
  Acore may need to use some TPM resources of Mcore on some SoC platforms.
  This driver provide a protocol to send pwm request through RPMSG to
  Mcore and control the TPM modules on Mcore.
  Mcore will operate its TPM modules according to the Acore request.
