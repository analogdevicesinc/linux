description: |
  PF5300 is a PMIC designed for high performance consumer applications.
  It features five high efficiency buck converters. It has built-in one
  time programmable fuse bank for device configurations.
  The definition for each of these nodes is defined using the standard
  binding for regulators at
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/regulator/regulator.yaml.
