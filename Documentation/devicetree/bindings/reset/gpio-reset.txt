GPIO reset controller
=====================

A GPIO reset controller controls a single GPIO that is connected to the reset
pin of a peripheral IC. Please also refer to reset.txt in this directory for
common reset controller binding usage.

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "gpio-reset"
- reset-gpios: A gpio used as reset line. The gpio specifier for this property
               depends on the gpio controller that provides the gpio.
- #reset-cells: 0, see below

Optional properties:
- reset-delay-us: delay in microseconds. The gpio reset line will be asserted for
                  this duration to reset.
- initially-in-reset: boolean. If not set, the initial state should be a
                      deasserted reset line. If this property exists, the
                      reset line should be kept in reset.

example:

sii902x_reset: gpio-reset {
	compatible = "gpio-reset";
	reset-gpios = <&gpio5 0 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
	reset-delay-us = <10000>;
	initially-in-reset;
	#reset-cells = <0>;
};

/* Device with nRESET pin connected to GPIO5_0 */
sii902x@39 {
	/* ... */
	resets = <&sii902x_reset>; /* active-low GPIO5_0, 10 ms delay */
};
