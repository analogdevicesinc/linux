NXP Display Mix mipi-rst Reset Controller
=========================================

This binding describes a reset controller device that is used to reset
or de-reset the MIPI DPHY master direction(for MIPI DSI) and slave
direction(for MIPI CSI) included by the Display Mix subsystem on IMX8MM
and IMX8MN platforms. Like sft-rstn, only assert and deassert functions
are required for PHY reset or de-reset.

Please also refer to reset.txt in this directory for common reset
controller binding usage.

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "fsl,imx8mm-dispmix-mipi-rst" or
			"fsl,imx8mn-dispmix-mipi-rst".
- reg: should be register base and length as documented in the datasheet.
- clocks: phandle and clock specifier to disp apb clock for register access.
- clock-names: should be "disp-apb".
- power-domains: phandle to dispmix power domain.
- reset-cells: 1, see below.

example:

	dispmix_mipi_rst: dispmix-mipi-rst@32e28008 {
		compatible = "fsl,imx8mn-dispmix-mipi-rst";
		reg = <0x0 0x32e28008 0x0 0x4>;
		clocks = <&clk IMX8MN_CLK_DISP_APB_ROOT>;
		clock-names = "disp-apb";
		active_low;
		power-domains = <&dispmix_pd>;
		#reset-cells = <1>;
	};

Specifying mipi-rst control of devices
======================================

Device nodes in Display Mix should specify the reset channel required in
their "resets" property, containing a phandle to the mipi-rst device node
and an index to specify which channel to use, as described in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/reset/reset.txt.

example:

	mipi_dsi_resets: mipi-dsi-resets {
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		#reset-cells = <0>;

		dsi-mipi-reset {
			compatible = "dsi,mipi-reset";
			resets = <&dispmix_mipi_rst IMX8MN_MIPI_M_RESET>;
                };
	};

Macro definitions for the supported reset channels can be found in:
include/dt-bindings/reset/imx8mm-dispmix.h and
include/dt-bindings/reset/imx8mn-dispmix.h.
