Checking for needed translation updates
=======================================

This script helps track the translation status of the documentation in
different locales, i.e.,Â whether the documentation is up-to-date with
the English counterpart.

How it works
------------

It uses ``git log`` command to track the latest English commit from the
translation commit (order by author date) and the latest English commits
from HEAD. If any differences occur, the file is considered as out-of-date,
then commits that need to be updated will be collected and reported.

Features implemented

-  check all files in a certain locale
-  check a single file or a set of files
-  provide options to change output format
-  track the translation status of files that have no translation

Usage
-----

::

   ./scripts/checktransupdate.py --help

Please refer to the output of argument parser for usage details.

Samples

-  ``./scripts/checktransupdate.py -l zh_CN``
   This will print all the files that need to be updated in the zh_CN locale.
-  ``./scripts/checktransupdate.py Documentation/translations/zh_CN/dev-tools/testing-overview.rst``
   This will only print the status of the specified file.

Then the output is something like:

::

    Documentation/dev-tools/kfence.rst
    No translation in the locale of zh_CN

    Documentation/translations/zh_CN/dev-tools/testing-overview.rst
    commit 42fb9cfd5b18 ("Documentation: dev-tools: Add link to RV docs")
    1 commits needs resolving in total

Features to be implemented

- files can be a folder instead of only a file
