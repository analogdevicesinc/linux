Intel Stratix10 SoC Service Layer
---------------------------------
Some features of the Intel Stratix10 SoC require a level of privilege
higher than the kernel is granted. Such secure features include
FPGA programming. In terms of the ARMv8 architecture, the kernel runs
at Exception Level 1 (EL1), access to the features requires
Exception Level 3 (EL3).

The Intel Stratix10 SoC service layer provides an in kernel API for
drivers to request access to the secure features. The requests are queued
and processed one by one. ARMâ€™s SMCCC is used to pass the execution
of the requests on to a secure monitor (EL3).

NXP i.MX Secure Enclave Enabled SoC Service layer and C_DEV driver
------------------------------------------------------------------
The NXP's i.MX HW IP like EdgeLock-Enclave, creating an embedded secure
enclave within the SoC boundary to enable features like
 - HSM
 - SHE
 - V2X

SoC enabled with the NXP i.MX secure enclave IP(s) like EdgeLock-Enclave(ELE),
are: i.MX93, i.MX8ULP.

This driver exposes two interfaces:
- service layer: This layer takes the two mutex locks:
  "mu_cmd_lock" is taken to ensure one service is processed at a time. This
  lock is not unlocked, till one service processing is complete. Multiple
  messages can be exchanged with FW as part of one service processing.
  "mu_lock" is taken to ensure one message is sent over MU at a time. This
  lock is unlocked, post sending the message.

- c_dev:
  This driver configures multiple misc-devices on the MU, to exchange
  messages from User-space application and NXP's Edgelocke Enclave firmware.
  The driver ensures that the messages must follow the following protocol
  defined.

When a user sends a command to the firmware, it registers its device_ctx
as waiter of a response from firmware.

Enclave's Firmware owns the storage management, over linux filesystem.
For this c_dev provisions a dedicated slave device called "receiver".
