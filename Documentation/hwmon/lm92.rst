Description
-----------

This driver implements support for the National Semiconductor / Texas
Instruments LM92 temperature sensor.

Each LM92 temperature sensor supports a single temperature sensor. There are
alarms for high, low, and critical thresholds. There's also an hysteresis to
control the thresholds for resetting alarms.

The driver also supports LM76 and Maxim MAX6633/MAX6634/MAX6635, which are
mostly compatible but do not have a vendor ID register and therefore must be
instantiated explicitly.
