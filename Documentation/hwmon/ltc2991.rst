Description
-----------

This driver supports hardware monitoring for Analog Devices LTC2991 Octal I2C
Voltage, Current and Temperature Monitor.

The LTC2991 is used to monitor system temperatures, voltages and currents.
Through the I2C serial interface, the eight monitors can individually measure
supply voltages and can be paired for differential measurements of current sense
resistors or temperature sensing transistors. Additional measurements include
internal temperatureand internal VCC.
