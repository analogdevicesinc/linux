Description
___________

The LTC4282 hot swap controller allows a board to be safely inserted and removed
from a live backplane. Using one or more external N-channel pass transistors,
board supply voltage and inrush current are ramped up at an adjustable rate. An
I2C interface and onboard ADC allows for monitoring of board current, voltage,
power, energy and fault status. The device features analog foldback current
limiting and supply monitoring for applications from 2.9V to 33V. Dual 12V gate
drive allows high power applications to either share safe operating area across
parallel MOSFETs or support a 2-stage start-up that first charges the load
capacitance followed by enabling a low on-resistance path to the load. The
LTC4282 is well suited to high power applications because the precise monitoring
capability and accurate current limiting reduce the extremes in which both loads
and power supplies must safely operate. Non-volatile configuration allows for
flexibility in the autonomous generation of alerts and response to faults.

Sysfs entries

DebugFs entries
_______________

The chip also has a fault log register where failures can be logged. Hence,
as these are logging events, we give access to them in debugfs. Note that
even if some failure is detected in these logs, it does necessarily mean
that the failure is still present. As mentioned in the proper Sysfs entries,
these logs can be cleared by writing in the proper reset_history attribute.

.. warning:: The debugfs interface is subject to change without notice
             and is only available when the kernel is compiled with
             ``CONFIG_DEBUG_FS`` defined.

``/sys/kernel/debug/ltc4282-hwmon[X]/``
contains the following attributes:

=======================  ==========================================
power1_bad_fault_log     Set to 1 by a power1 bad fault occurring.
in0_fet_short_fault_log	 Set to 1 when the ADC detects a FET-short fault.
in0_fet_bad_fault_log    Set to 1 when a FET-BAD fault occurs.
in1_crit_fault_log       Set to 1 by a VDD overvoltage fault occurring.
in1_lcrit_fault_log      Set to 1 by a VDD undervoltage fault occurring.
curr1_crit_fault_log	 Set to 1 by an overcurrent fault occurring.
