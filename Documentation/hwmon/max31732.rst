Description
-----------

This driver implements support for Maxim MAX31732.

The MAX31732 is a multi-channel temperature sensor that monitors its
own temperature and the temperatures of up to four external diodeconnected
transistors. The device operates with 3.0V to 3.6V supply range
and consume TBDμA of current in standby mode of operation. Resistance
cancellation feature compensates for high series resistance between
circuit-board traces and the external thermal diode, while beta
compensation corrects for temperature-measurement errors due to lowbeta
sensing transistors.

The MAX31732 offers two open-drain, active-low alarm outputs,
ALARM1 and ALARM2. When the measured temperature of a channel
crosses the respective primary over/under temperature threshold levels
ALARM1 asserts low and a status bit is set in the corresponding thermal
status registers. When the measured temperature of a channel crosses the
secondary over/under temperature threshold levels, ALARM2 asserts low
and a status bit is set in the corresponding thermal status registers.

Temperature measurement range: from -64°C to 150°C

Temperature Resolution: 12 Bits, ±0.0625°C
