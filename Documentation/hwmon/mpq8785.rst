Kernel driver mpq8785
=======================

Supported chips:

  * MPS MPQ8785

    Prefix: 'mpq8785'

Description
-----------

The MPQ8785 is a fully integrated, PMBus-compatible, high-frequency, synchronous
buck converter. The MPQ8785 offers a very compact solution that achieves up to
40A output current per phase, with excellent load and line regulation over a
wide input supply range. The MPQ8785 operates at high efficiency over a wide
output current load range.

The PMBus interface provides converter configurations and key parameters
monitoring.

The MPQ8785 adopts MPS's proprietary multi-phase digital constant-on-time (MCOT)
control, which provides fast transient response and eases loop stabilization.
The MCOT scheme also allows multiple MPQ8785 devices to be connected in parallel
with excellent current sharing and phase interleaving for high-current
applications.

Fully integrated protection features include over-current protection (OCP),
over-voltage protection (OVP), under-voltage protection (UVP), and
over-temperature protection (OTP).

The MPQ8785 requires a minimal number of readily available, standard external
components, and is available in a TLGA (5mmx6mm) package.

- PMBus rev 1.3 interface.
