Description
-----------

This driver implements support for the ChargerLAB POWER-Z USB-C power testing
family.

The device communicates with the custom protocol over USB.

The channel labels exposed via hwmon match the labels used by the on-device
display and the official POWER-Z PC software.

As current can flow in both directions through the tester the sign of the
channel "curr1_input" (label "IBUS") indicates the direction.
