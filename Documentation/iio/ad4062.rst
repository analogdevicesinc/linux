=============
AD4062 driver
=============

ADC driver for Analog Devices Inc. AD4060/AD4062 devices. The module name is
``ad4062``.

Supported devices
=================

The following chips are supported by this driver:

* `AD4060 <https://www.analog.com/AD4060>`_
* `AD4062 <https://www.analog.com/AD4062>`_

Wiring modes
============

The ADC is interfaced through an I3C bus, and contains two programmable GPIOs.

The ADC convert-start happens on the SDA rising edge of the I3C stop (P) bit
at the end of the read command.

The two programmable GPIOS are optional and have a role assigned if present in
the devicetree:

- GP1: Is assigned the role of Data Ready signal.

Device attributes
=================

The ADC contains only one channel with following attributes:

.. list-table:: Channel attributes
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Attribute
     - Description
   * - ``in_voltage_calibscale``
     - Sets the scale factor to multiply the raw value.
   * - ``in_voltage_oversampling_ratio``
     - Sets device's burst averaging mode to over sample using the
       internal sample rate. Value 1 disable the burst averaging mode.
   * - ``in_voltage_oversampling_ratio_available``
     - List of available oversampling values.
   * - ``in_voltage_raw``
     - Returns the raw ADC voltage value.
   * - ``in_voltage_scale``
     - Returs the channel scale in reference to the reference voltage
       ``ref-supply``.

Also contain the following device attributes:

.. list-table:: Device attributes
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Attribute
     - Description
   * - ``samling_frequency``
     - Sets the sets the device internal sample rate, used in the burst
       averaging mode.
   * - ``sampling_frequency_available``
     - Lists the available device internal sample rates.

Interrupts
==========

The interrupts are mapped through the ``interrupt-names`` and ``interrupts``
properties.

The ``interrupt-names`` ``gp1`` entry sets the role of Data Ready signal.
If it is not present, the driver fallback to enabling the same role as an
I3C IBI.

Low-power mode
==============

The device enters low-power mode on idle to save power. Enabling an event puts
the device out of the low-power since the ADC autonomously samples to assert
the event condition.

Unimplemented features
======================

- Monitor mode
- Trigger mode
- Averaging mode
