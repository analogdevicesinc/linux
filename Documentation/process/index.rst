Working with the kernel development community
=============================================

So you want to be a Linux kernel developer?  Welcome!  While there is a lot
to be learned about the kernel in a technical sense, it is also important
to learn about how our community works.  Reading these documents will make
it much easier for you to get your changes merged with a minimum of
trouble.

An introduction to how kernel development works
-----------------------------------------------

Read these documents first: an understanding of the material here will ease
your entry into the kernel community.
