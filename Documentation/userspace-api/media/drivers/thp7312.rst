THine THP7312 ISP driver
========================

The THP7312 driver implements the following driver-specific controls:

``V4L2_CID_THP7312_LOW_LIGHT_COMPENSATION``
    Enable/Disable auto-adjustment, based on lighting conditions, of the frame
    rate when auto-exposure is enabled.

``V4L2_CID_THP7312_AUTO_FOCUS_METHOD``
    Set method of auto-focus. Only takes effect when auto-focus is enabled.

    .. flat-table::
        :header-rows:  0
        :stub-columns: 0
        :widths:       1 4

        * - ``0``
          - Contrast-based auto-focus
        * - ``1``
          - PDAF
        * - ``2``
          - Hybrid of contrast-based and PDAF

    Supported values for the control depend on the camera sensor module
    connected to the THP7312. If the module doesn't have a focus lens actuator,
    this control will not be exposed by the THP7312 driver. If the module has a
    controllable focus lens but the sensor doesn't support PDAF, only the
    contrast-based auto-focus value will be valid. Otherwise all values for the
    controls will be supported.

``V4L2_CID_THP7312_NOISE_REDUCTION_AUTO``
    Enable/Disable auto noise reduction.

``V4L2_CID_THP7312_NOISE_REDUCTION_ABSOLUTE``
    Set the noise reduction strength, where 0 is the weakest and 10 is the
    strongest.
