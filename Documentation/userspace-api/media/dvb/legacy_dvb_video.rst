DVB Video Device

.. attention:: Do **not** use in new drivers!
             See: :ref:`legacy_dvb_decoder_notes`

The DVB video device controls the MPEG2 video decoder of the DVB
hardware. It can be accessed through ``/dev/dvb/adapter0/video0``. Data
types and ioctl definitions can be accessed by including
``linux/dvb/video.h`` in your application.

Note that the DVB video device only controls decoding of the MPEG video
stream, not its presentation on the TV or computer screen. On PCs this
is typically handled by an associated video4linux device, e.g.
``/dev/video``, which allows scaling and defining output windows.

Most DVB cards donâ€™t have their own MPEG decoder, which results in the
omission of the audio and video device as well as the video4linux
device.

These ioctls were also used by V4L2 to control MPEG decoders implemented
in V4L2. The use of these ioctls for that purpose has been made obsolete
and proper V4L2 ioctls or controls have been created to replace that
functionality. Use :ref:`V4L2 ioctls<video>` for new drivers!

video_format_t
--------------

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: c

    typedef enum {
	VIDEO_FORMAT_4_3,
	VIDEO_FORMAT_16_9,
	VIDEO_FORMAT_221_1
    } video_format_t;

Constants
~~~~~~~~~

.. flat-table::
    :header-rows:  0
    :stub-columns: 0

    -  ..

       -  ``VIDEO_FORMAT_4_3``

       -  Select 4:3 format.

    -  ..

       -  ``VIDEO_FORMAT_16_9``

       -  Select 16:9 format.

    -  ..

       -  ``VIDEO_FORMAT_221_1``

       -  Select 2.21:1 format.

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``video_format_t`` data type
is used in the `VIDEO_SET_FORMAT`_ function to tell the driver which
aspect ratio the output hardware (e.g. TV) has. It is also used in the
data structures `video_status`_ returned by `VIDEO_GET_STATUS`_
and `video_event`_ returned by `VIDEO_GET_EVENT`_ which report
about the display format of the current video stream.

video_displayformat_t
---------------------

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: c

    typedef enum {
	VIDEO_PAN_SCAN,
	VIDEO_LETTER_BOX,
	VIDEO_CENTER_CUT_OUT
    } video_displayformat_t;

Constants
~~~~~~~~~

.. flat-table::
    :header-rows:  0

       -  Use letterbox format.

    -  ..

       -  ``VIDEO_CENTER_CUT_OUT``

       -  Use center cut out format.

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

In case the display format of the video stream and of the display
hardware differ the application has to specify how to handle the
cropping of the picture. This can be done using the
`VIDEO_SET_DISPLAY_FORMAT`_ call which accepts this enum as argument.

       -  If this source is selected, the stream
          comes from the user through the write
          system call.

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

The video stream source is set through the `VIDEO_SELECT_SOURCE`_ call
and can take the following values, depending on whether we are replaying
from an internal (demuxer) or external (user write) source.
VIDEO_SOURCE_DEMUX selects the demultiplexer (fed either by the
frontend or the DVR device) as the source of the video stream. If
VIDEO_SOURCE_MEMORY is selected the stream comes from the application
through the `write()`_ system call.

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

.. attention:: Do **not** use in new drivers!
             See: :ref:`legacy_dvb_decoder_notes`

This ioctl is for Digital TV devices only. This ioctl was also supported
by the V4L2 ivtv driver, but that has been replaced by the ivtv-specific
``IVTV_IOC_PASSTHROUGH_MODE`` ioctl.

This ioctl call informs the video device which source shall be used for
the input data. The possible sources are demux or memory. If memory is
selected, the data is fed to the video device through the write command
using the struct `video_stream_source_t`_. If demux is selected, the data
is directly transferred from the onboard demux-device to the decoder.

The data fed to the decoder is also controlled by the PID-filter.
Output selection: :c:type:`dmx_output` ``DMX_OUT_DECODER``.

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

.. attention:: Do **not** use in new drivers!
             See: :ref:`legacy_dvb_decoder_notes`

This ioctl is for DVB devices only. To get events from a V4L2 decoder
use the V4L2 :ref:`VIDIOC_DQEVENT` ioctl instead.

This ioctl call returns an event of type `video_event`_ if available. A
certain number of the latest events will be cued and returned in order of
occurrence. Older events may be discarded if not fetched in time. If
an event is not available, the behavior depends on whether the device is
in blocking or non-blocking mode. In the latter case, the call fails
immediately with errno set to ``EWOULDBLOCK``. In the former case, the
call blocks until an event becomes available. The standard Linux poll()
and/or select() system calls can be used with the device file descriptor
to watch for new events. For select(), the file descriptor should be
included in the exceptfds argument, and for poll(), POLLPRI should be
specified as the wake-up condition. Read-only permissions are sufficient
for this ioctl call.

Return Value
~~~~~~~~~~~~

On success 0 is returned, on error -1 and the ``errno`` variable is set
appropriately. The generic error codes are described at the

When an open() call has succeeded, the device will be ready for use. The
significance of blocking or non-blocking mode is described in the
documentation for functions where there is a difference. It does not
affect the semantics of the open() call itself. A device opened in
blocking mode can later be put into non-blocking mode (and vice versa)
using the F_SETFL command of the fcntl system call. This is a standard
system call, documented in the Linux manual page for fcntl. Only one
user can open the Video Device in O_RDWR mode. All other attempts to
open the device in this mode will fail, and an error-code will be
returned. If the Video Device is opened in O_RDONLY mode, the only
ioctl call that can be used is `VIDEO_GET_STATUS`_. All other call will
return an error code.

.. c:function:: size_t write(int fd, const void *buf, size_t count)

Arguments
~~~~~~~~~

.. flat-table::
    :header-rows:  0
    :stub-columns: 0

    -  ..

       -  ``int fd``

       -  :cspan:`1` File descriptor returned by a previous call
          to `open()`_.

    -  ..

       -  ``void *buf``

       -  Pointer to the buffer containing the PES data.

    -  ..

       -  ``size_t count``

       -  Size of buf.

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

This system call can only be used if VIDEO_SOURCE_MEMORY is selected
in the ioctl call `VIDEO_SELECT_SOURCE`_. The data provided shall be in
PES format, unless the capability allows other formats. TS is the
most common format for storing DVB-data, it is usually supported too.
If O_NONBLOCK is not specified the function will block until buffer space
is available. The amount of data to be transferred is implied by count.

.. note:: See: :ref:`DVB Data Formats <legacy_dvb_decoder_formats>`

       -  :cspan:`1` Mode ``VIDEO_SOURCE_MEMORY`` not selected.

    -  ..

       -  ``ENOMEM``

       -  Attempted to write more data than the internal buffer can hold.

    -  ..

       -  ``EBADF``

       -  fd is not a valid open file descriptor.
