# ADI CI/CD

This orphan branch is used to maintain Github reusable workflows to be used by
development branches. Since development branches are designed to contain
changes for upstream projects it is better to keep ADI specific changes (like
CI/CD workflows) as minimal as possible on those branches. This also reduces
the need to synchronize CI/CD changes between development branches.
