 * For vGICv5, we need to consolidate two views:
 *   - The vcpu ID assigned by userspace, which it can assign however it
 *     sees fit.
 *   - The index into the VPET, which is also presented to the guest as
 *     the IAFFID for the VPE in question.
 *
 * Ideally, we don't want to intercept the guest setting an interrupt's affinity
 * - this would somewhat defeat the point of allowing the hardware to manage the
 * interrupt directly. Therefore, we need to use vcpu->vcpu_id as our VPE ID,
 * which ensures that both userspace and the GICv5 hardware have a consistent
 * view.
 *
 * This means two things:
 *   - Our VPET might be sparse, depending on the IDs picked by userspace.
 *   - We need to check the vcpu ID provided by userspace, and reject anything
 *     we cannot handle.
 *
 * In order to at least ensure consistent usage in the places that we need to
 * use the VPE ID, we provide this helper.
