config IMX_DSP

	help
	  This enables DSP IPC protocol between host AP (Linux)
	  and the firmware running on DSP.
	  DSP exists on some i.MX8 processors (e.g i.MX8QM, i.MX8QXP).

	  It acts like a doorbell. Client might use shared memory to
	  exchange information with DSP side.

	help
	  The System Controller Firmware (SCFW) is a low-level system function
	  which runs on a dedicated Cortex-M core to provide power, clock, and
	  resource management. It exists on some i.MX8 processors. e.g. i.MX8QM
	  (QM, QP), and i.MX8QX (QXP, DX).

	  This driver manages the IPC interface between host CPU and the
	  SCU firmware running on M4.

	help
	  The System Controller Management Interface firmware (SCMI FW) is
	  a low-level system function which runs on a dedicated Cortex-M
	  core that could provide misc functions such as board control.

	  This driver can also be built as a module.

	help
	  It is possible to use APIs exposed by the iMX Secure Enclave HW IP called:
	  - EdgeLock Enclave Firmware (for i.MX8ULP, i.MX93, i.MX95),
	  - SECO (for i.MX8DXL, i.MXQM, i.MXQXP),
	    like base, HSM, V2X & SHE using the SAB protocol via the shared Messaging
	    Unit. This driver exposes these interfaces via a set of file descriptors
	    allowing to configure shared memory, send and receive messages.

	tristate "i.MX ELE True Random Number Generator"
	depends on IMX_SEC_ENCLAVE

	help
	  With platforms having secure enclave as the only true source for
	  generating true random number, the config CONFIG_ELE_TRNG needs to be enabled.
	  This config helps provides kernel-side support for the Random Number generation,
          through NXP hardware IP for secure-enclave(s), called EdgeLock Enclave.
