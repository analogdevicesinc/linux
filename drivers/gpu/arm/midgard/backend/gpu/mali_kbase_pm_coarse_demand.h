/**
 * DOC:
 * The "Coarse" demand power management policy has the following
 * characteristics:
 * - When KBase indicates that the GPU will be powered up, but we don't yet
 *   know which Job Chains are to be run:
 *  - Shader Cores are powered up, regardless of whether or not they will be
 *    needed later.
 * - When KBase indicates that Shader Cores are needed to submit the currently
 *   queued Job Chains:
 *  - Shader Cores are kept powered, regardless of whether or not they will
 *    be needed
 * - When KBase indicates that the GPU need not be powered:
 *  - The Shader Cores are powered off, and the GPU itself is powered off too.
 *
 * @note:
 * - KBase indicates the GPU will be powered up when it has a User Process that
 *   has just started to submit Job Chains.
 * - KBase indicates the GPU need not be powered when all the Job Chains from
 *   User Processes have finished, and it is waiting for a User Process to
 *   submit some more Job Chains.
