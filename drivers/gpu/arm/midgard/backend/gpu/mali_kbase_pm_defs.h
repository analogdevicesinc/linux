 *                machine
 * @l2_always_on: If true, disable powering down of l2 cache.
 * @shaders_state: The current state of the shader state machine.

 *                 where it can write to the SHADER_PWRON or PWROFF registers
 *                 to have the same set of available cores as specified by
 *                 @shaders_desired_mask. So would precisely indicate the cores
 *                 that are currently available. This is internal to shader
 *                 state machine of JM GPUs and should *not* be modified
 *                 elsewhere.
 * @shaders_desired_mask: This is updated by the state machine when it is in
 *                        a state where it can handle changes to the core
 *                        availability (either by DVFS or sysfs). This is

 *                        *not* be modified elsewhere.
 * @shaders_desired: True if the PM active count or power policy requires the
 *                   shader cores to be on. This is used as an input to the
 *                   shader power state machine.  The current state of the

 *                   progress that will eventually achieve this state (assuming
 *                   that the policy doesn't change its mind in the mean time).
 * @mcu_desired: True if the micro-control unit should be powered on
 * @policy_change_clamp_state_to_off: Signaling the backend is in PM policy
 *                change transition, needs the mcu/L2 to be brought back to the
 *                off state and remain in that state until the flag is cleared.
 * @csf_pm_sched_flags: CSF Dynamic PM control flags in accordance to the
 *                current active PM policy. This field is updated whenever a
 *                new policy is activated.
 * @policy_change_lock: Used to serialize the policy change calls. In CSF case,
 *                      the change of policy may involve the scheduler to
 *                      suspend running CSGs and then reconfigure the MCU.
 * @core_idle_wq: Workqueue for executing the @core_idle_work.
 * @core_idle_work: Work item used to wait for undesired cores to become inactive.
 *                  The work item is enqueued when Host controls the power for
 *                  shader cores and down scaling of cores is performed.
 * @gpu_sleep_supported: Flag to indicate that if GPU sleep feature can be
 *                       supported by the kernel driver or not. If this
 *                       flag is not set, then HW state is directly saved
 *                       when GPU idle notification is received.
 * @gpu_sleep_mode_active: Flag to indicate that the GPU needs to be in sleep
 *                         mode. It is set when the GPU idle notification is
 *                         received and is cleared when HW state has been
 *                         saved in the runtime suspend callback function or
 *                         when the GPU power down is aborted if GPU became
 *                         active whilst it was in sleep mode. The flag is
 *                         guarded with hwaccess_lock spinlock.
 * @exit_gpu_sleep_mode: Flag to indicate the GPU can now exit the sleep
 *                       mode due to the submission of work from Userspace.
 *                       The flag is guarded with hwaccess_lock spinlock.
 *                       The @gpu_sleep_mode_active flag is not immediately
 *                       reset when this flag is set, this is to ensure that
 *                       MCU doesn't gets disabled undesirably without the
 *                       suspend of CSGs. That could happen when
 *                       scheduler_pm_active() and scheduler_pm_idle() gets
 *                       called before the Scheduler gets reactivated.
 * @gpu_idled: Flag to ensure that the gpu_idle & gpu_active callbacks are
 *             always called in pair. The flag is guarded with pm.lock mutex.
 * @gpu_wakeup_override: Flag to force the power up of L2 cache & reactivation
 *                       of MCU. This is set during the runtime suspend
 *                       callback function, when GPU needs to exit the sleep
 *                       mode for the saving the HW state before power down.
 * @db_mirror_interrupt_enabled: Flag tracking if the Doorbell mirror interrupt
 *                               is enabled or not.
 * @in_reset: True if a GPU is resetting and normal power manager operation is
 *            suspended
 * @partial_shaderoff: True if we want to partial power off shader cores,
 *                     it indicates a partial shader core off case,
 *                     do some special operation for such case like flush
 *                     L2 cache because of GPU2017-861
 * @protected_entry_transition_override : True if GPU reset is being used
 *                                  before entering the protected mode and so
 *                                  the reset handling behaviour is being
 *                                  overridden.
 * @protected_transition_override : True if a protected mode transition is in
 *                                  progress and is overriding power manager
 *                                  behaviour.
