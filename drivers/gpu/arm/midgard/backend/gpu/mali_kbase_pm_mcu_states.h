 * Backend-specific Power Manager MCU state definitions.
 * The function-like macro KBASEP_MCU_STATE() must be defined before including
 * this header file. This header file can be included multiple times in the
 * same compilation unit with different definitions of KBASEP_MCU_STATE().
 *
 * @OFF:                      The MCU is powered off.
 * @PEND_ON_RELOAD:           The warm boot of MCU or cold boot of MCU (with
 *                            firmware reloading) is in progress.
 * @ON_GLB_REINIT_PEND:       The MCU is enabled and Global configuration
 *                            requests have been sent to the firmware.
 * @ON_HWCNT_ENABLE:          The Global requests have completed and MCU is now
 *                            ready for use and hwcnt is being enabled.
 * @ON:                       The MCU is active and hwcnt has been enabled.
 * @ON_CORE_ATTR_UPDATE_PEND: The MCU is active and mask of enabled shader cores
 *                            is being updated.
 * @ON_HWCNT_DISABLE:         The MCU is on and hwcnt is being disabled.
 * @ON_HALT:                  The MCU is on and hwcnt has been disabled, MCU
 *                            halt would be triggered.
 * @ON_PEND_HALT:             MCU halt in progress, confirmation pending.
 * @POWER_DOWN:               MCU halted operations, pending being disabled.
 * @PEND_OFF:                 MCU is being disabled, pending on powering off.
 * @RESET_WAIT:               The GPU is resetting, MCU state is unknown.
 * @HCTL_SHADERS_PEND_ON:     Global configuration requests sent to the firmware
 *                            have completed and shaders have been requested to
 *                            power on.
 * @HCTL_CORES_NOTIFY_PEND:   Shader cores have powered up and firmware is being
 *                            notified of the mask of enabled shader cores.
 * @HCTL_MCU_ON_RECHECK:      MCU is on and hwcnt disabling is triggered
 *                            and checks are done to increase the number of
 *                            enabled cores.
 * @HCTL_SHADERS_READY_OFF:   MCU has halted and cores need to be powered down
 * @HCTL_SHADERS_PEND_OFF:    Cores are transitioning to power down.
 * @ON_SLEEP_INITIATE:        MCU is on and hwcnt has been disabled and MCU
 *                            is being put to sleep.
 * @ON_PEND_SLEEP:            MCU sleep is in progress.
 * @IN_SLEEP:                 Sleep request is completed and MCU has halted.
