 *                       counter model for top-level.
 * @num_top_level_cntrs: Number of elements in @top_level_cntrs_def array.
 * @shader_cores_cntrs_def: Array of description of HW counters used by the IPA
 *                       counter model for shader cores.
 * @num_shader_cores_cntrs: Number of elements in @shader_cores_cntrs_def array.
 * @counter_coeffs:      Buffer to store coefficient value used for HW counters
 * @counter_values:      Buffer to store the accumulated value of HW counters
 *                       retreived from kbase_ipa_control.
 * @num_counters:        Number of counters queried from kbase_ipa_control.
 * @reference_voltage:   voltage, in mV, of the operating point used when
 *                       deriving the power model coefficients. Range approx
 *                       0.1V - 5V (~= 8V): 2^7 <= reference_voltage <= 2^13
 * @scaling_factor:      User-specified power scaling factor. This is an
 *                       integer, which is multiplied by the power coefficient
 *                       just before OPP scaling.

 *                       cycles the GPU was working) is less than
 *                       min_sample_cycles, the counter model will return an
 *                       error, causing the IPA framework to approximate using
 *                       the cached simple model results instead. This may be
 *                       more accurate than extrapolating using a very small
 *                       counter dump.
