 *                        which can alias number of memory regions. The page is

 *                        cache setup, typically used when the write result of the

 *                        GPU virtual address.
 * @event_queue:          Wait queue used for blocking the thread, which consumes

 *                        process whose thread opened the device file
 *                        /dev/malixx instance.
 * @pid:                  ID of the thread, corresponding to process @tgid,

 * @mem_pools:            Context-specific pools of free physical memory pages.

 *                        the pointer to callback function which is invoked under

 *                        If the context relating to this value of as_nr is required,
 *                        then the context must be retained to ensure that it doesn't
 *                        disappear whilst it is being used. Alternatively, hwaccess_lock
 *                        can be held to ensure the context doesn't disappear (but this
 *                        has restrictions on what other locks can be taken simutaneously).
 * @refcount:             Keeps track of the number of users of this context. A user

 *                        needing to 'pin' a context for counter collection, etc.
 *                        If the refcount reaches 0 then this context is considered
 *                        inactive and the previously programmed AS might be cleared
 *                        at any point.
 *                        Generally the reference count is incremented when the context
 *                        is scheduled in and an atom is pulled from the context's per
 *                        slot runnable tree in JM GPU or GPU command queue

 * @blocked_js:           Indicates if the context is blocked from submitting atoms

 *                        the runnable RB-tree.
 * @trim_level:           Level of JIT allocation trimming to perform on free (0-100%)

 *                        under kbase_process.

 *                        kbase_context.reg_lock.
 * @gwt_was_enabled:      Simple sticky bit flag to know if GWT was ever enabled.
 * @gwt_current_list:     A list of addresses for which GPU has generated write faults,
 *                        after the last snapshot of it was sent to userspace.
 * @gwt_snapshot_list:    Snapshot of the @gwt_current_list for sending to user space.
 * @priority:             Indicates the context priority. Used along with @atoms_count
 *                        for context scheduling, protected by hwaccess_lock.
 * @atoms_count:          Number of GPU atoms currently in use, per priority
 * @create_flags:         Flags used in context creation.
 * @kinstr_jm:            Kernel job manager instrumentation context handle
 * @tl_kctx_list_node:    List item into the device timeline's list of

 *
 * A kernel base context is an entity among which the GPU is scheduled.
 * Each context has its own GPU address space.
 * Up to one context can be created for each client that opens the device file
 * /dev/malixx. Context creation is deferred until a special ioctl() system call
 * is made on the device file.
