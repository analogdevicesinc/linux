/* These are memory addresses as would be seen by one or more EEPROM
 * chips strung on the I2C bus, usually by manipulating pins 1-3 of a
 * set of EEPROM devices. They form a continuous memory space.
 *
 * The I2C device address includes the device type identifier, 1010b,
 * which is a reserved value and indicates that this is an I2C EEPROM
 * device. It also includes the top 3 bits of the 19 bit EEPROM memory
 * address, namely bits 18, 17, and 16. This makes up the 7 bit
 * address sent on the I2C bus with bit 0 being the direction bit,
 * which is not represented here, and sent by the hardware directly.
 *
 * For instance,
 *   50h = 1010000b => device type identifier 1010b, bits 18:16 = 000b, address 0.
 *   54h = 1010100b => --"--, bits 18:16 = 100b, address 40000h.
 *   56h = 1010110b => --"--, bits 18:16 = 110b, address 60000h.
 * Depending on the size of the I2C EEPROM device(s), bits 18:16 may
 * address memory in a device or a device on the I2C bus, depending on
 * the status of pins 1-3. See top of amdgpu_eeprom.c.
 *
 * The RAS table lives either at address 0 or address 40000h of EEPROM.
