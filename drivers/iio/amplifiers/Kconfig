	help
	  Say yes here to build support for Analog Devices AD8366 and similar
	  gain amplifiers. This driver supports the following gain amplifiers
	  from Analog Devices:
	    AD8366 Dual-Digital Variable Gain Amplifier (VGA)
	    ADA4961 BiCMOS RF Digital Gain Amplifier (DGA)
	    ADL5240 Digitally controlled variable gain amplifier (VGA)
	    HMC271 1 dB LSB GaAs MMIC 5-BIT Control Digital Attenuator
	    HMC1119 0.25 dB LSB, 7-Bit, Silicon Digital Attenuator

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called ad8366.

config AD916X_AMP
	tristate "Analog Devices AD916x Amplifiers"
	depends on SPI
	help
	  Say yes here to build support for Analog Devices AD916x
	  SPI Amplifier's support. This devices act as output buffer's
	  in the AD916x DAC families.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called ad916x_amp.

config ADA4250
	tristate "Analog Devices ADA4250 Instrumentation Amplifier"
	depends on SPI
	help
	  Say yes here to build support for Analog Devices ADA4250
	  SPI Amplifier's support. The driver provides direct access via
          sysfs.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called ada4250.

config HMC425
	tristate "Analog Devices HMC425A and similar GPIO Gain Amplifiers"
	depends on GPIOLIB
	help
	  Say yes here to build support for Analog Devices HMC425A and similar
	  gain amplifiers or step attenuators.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called hmc425a.
