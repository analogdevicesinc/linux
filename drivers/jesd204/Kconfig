	  The JESD204 is a "Serial Interface for data converters"
	  which describes a serialized interface between data converters
	  and logic devices. It contains normative information to enable
	  chip designers to implement devices that communicate with other
	  devices covered by this specification.

	  The JESD204 framework provides a unified model for supporting
	  initialization and operation of JESD204 transceivers, which aims
	  at reducing complexity when managing these types of devices.

	  Say yes here to build support for the generic jes204-top device.
	  The jesd204-top-device provides the link parameter for all other
	  link devices. Usually this is the converter device. However, in some
	  situations when using Multilink and some links are originating or
	  terminating on a separate system/FPGA entity, the converter device
	  itself might not be part of the TOPOLOGY.
	  This generic top-device can be used to provide the necessary
	  link parameters.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module will be
	  called jesd204_top_device.
