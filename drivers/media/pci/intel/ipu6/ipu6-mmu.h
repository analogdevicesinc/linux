 * MMU Invalidation HW bug workaround by ZLW mechanism
 *
 * Old IPU6 MMUV2 has a bug in the invalidation mechanism which might result in
 * wrong translation or replication of the translation. This will cause data
 * corruption. So we cannot directly use the MMU V2 invalidation registers
 * to invalidate the MMU. Instead, whenever an invalidate is called, we need to
 * clear the TLB by evicting all the valid translations by filling it with trash
 * buffer (which is guaranteed not to be used by any other processes). ZLW is
 * used to fill the L1 and L2 caches with the trash buffer translations. ZLW
 * or Zero length write, is pre-fetch mechanism to pre-fetch the pages in
 * advance to the L1 and L2 caches without triggering any memory operations.
 *
 * In MMU V2, L1 -> 16 streams and 64 blocks, maximum 16 blocks per stream
 * One L1 block has 16 entries, hence points to 16 * 4K pages
 * L2 -> 16 streams and 32 blocks. 2 blocks per streams
 * One L2 block maps to 1024 L1 entries, hence points to 4MB address range
 * 2 blocks per L2 stream means, 1 stream points to 8MB range
 *
 * As we need to clear the caches and 8MB being the biggest cache size, we need
 * to have trash buffer which points to 8MB address range. As these trash
 * buffers are not used for any memory transactions, we need only the least
 * amount of physical memory. So we reserve 8MB IOVA address range but only
 * one page is reserved from physical memory. Each of this 8MB IOVA address
 * range is then mapped to the same physical memory page.

/*
 * In some of the IPU6 MMUs, there is provision to configure L1 and L2 page
 * table caches. Both these L1 and L2 caches are divided into multiple sections
 * called streams. There is maximum 16 streams for both caches. Each of these
 * sections are subdivided into multiple blocks. When nr_l1streams = 0 and
 * nr_l2streams = 0, means the MMU is of type MMU_V1 and do not support
 * L1/L2 page table caches.
 *
 * L1 stream per block sizes are configurable and varies per usecase.
 * L2 has constant block sizes - 2 blocks per stream.
 *
 * MMU1 support pre-fetching of the pages to have less cache lookup misses. To
 * enable the pre-fetching, MMU1 AT (Address Translator) device registers
 * need to be configured.
 *
 * There are four types of memory accesses which requires ZLW configuration.
 * ZLW(Zero Length Write) is a mechanism to enable VT-d pre-fetching on IOMMU.
 *
 * 1. Sequential Access or 1D mode
 *	Set ZLW_EN -> 1
 *	set ZLW_PAGE_CROSS_1D -> 1
 *	Set ZLW_N to "N" pages so that ZLW will be inserte N pages ahead where
 *		  N is pre-defined and hardcoded in the platform data
 *	Set ZLW_2D -> 0
 *
 * 2. ZLW 2D mode
 *	Set ZLW_EN -> 1
 *	set ZLW_PAGE_CROSS_1D -> 1,
 *	Set ZLW_N -> 0
 *	Set ZLW_2D -> 1
 *
 * 3. ZLW Enable (no 1D or 2D mode)
 *	Set ZLW_EN -> 1
 *	set ZLW_PAGE_CROSS_1D -> 0,
 *	Set ZLW_N -> 0
 *	Set ZLW_2D -> 0
 *
 * 4. ZLW disable
 *	Set ZLW_EN -> 0
 *	set ZLW_PAGE_CROSS_1D -> 0,
 *	Set ZLW_N -> 0
 *	Set ZLW_2D -> 0
 *
 * To configure the ZLW for the above memory access, four registers are
 * available. Hence to track these four settings, we have the following entries
 * in the struct ipu6_mmu_hw. Each of these entries are per stream and
 * available only for the L1 streams.
 *
 * a. l1_zlw_en -> To track zlw enabled per stream (ZLW_EN)
 * b. l1_zlw_1d_mode -> Track 1D mode per stream. ZLW inserted at page boundary
 * c. l1_ins_zlw_ahead_pages -> to track how advance the ZLW need to be inserted
 *			Insert ZLW request N pages ahead address.
 * d. l1_zlw_2d_mode -> To track 2D mode per stream (ZLW_2D)
 *
 *
 * Currently L1/L2 streams, blocks, AT ZLW configurations etc. are pre-defined
 * as per the usecase specific calculations. Any change to this pre-defined
 * table has to happen in sync with IPU6 FW.
