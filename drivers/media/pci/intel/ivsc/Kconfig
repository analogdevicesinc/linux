	  This adds support for Intel Visual Sensing Controller (IVSC).

	  The IVSC support is split into two devices, ACE (Algorithm
	  Context Engine) and CSI (Camera Serial Interface), each of which
	  have their own drivers. The ACE is used to select the ownership
	  of the sensor between the IVSC and the host CPU while the CSI is
	  used to both select the routing destination for the data the
	  sensor transmits over the CSI-2 bus between the IVSC and the
	  host CPU and to configure the CSI-2 bus itself.

	  The modules will be called ivsc-ace and ivsc-csi.
