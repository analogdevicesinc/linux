	  This driver supports the KEBA CP500 system FPGA, which is used in
	  KEBA CP500 devices. It registers all sub devices present on the CP500
	  system FPGA as separate devices. A driver is needed for each sub
	  device.

	  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module will be
	  called cp500.
