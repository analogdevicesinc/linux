	default y
	help
	  If you have a network (Ethernet) card belonging to this class, say Y.

	  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the
	  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
	  the questions about Xilinx devices. If you say Y, you will be asked
	  for your specific card in the following questions.

config XILINX_EMACLITE
	tristate "Xilinx 10/100 Ethernet Lite support"
	depends on HAS_IOMEM
	select PHYLIB
	help
	  This driver supports the 10/100 Ethernet Lite from Xilinx.
