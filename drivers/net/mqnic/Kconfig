	  Corundum is an open-source, FPGA-based Network Interface Card (NIC)
	  and platform designed for high-performance networking and in-network
	  compute applications.

	  Say yes here to build support for Corundum network interface card.

	help
	  Enable support for Corundum MQNIC devices connected via the PCI bus.
	  Corundum supports both PCI and AXI interfaces, so enabling this
	  option allows the driver to work with PCIe-based hardware. If you are
	  targeting FPGA boards or systems that use PCIe for host communication,
	  select this option.
