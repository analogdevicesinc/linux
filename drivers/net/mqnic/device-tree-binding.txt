* Corundum mqnic Ethernet controller

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "corundum,mqnic"
- reg: Address and length of the "control" register set. Optionally a second and
	third range, the "app" and "ram" register sets may be added.
- interrupts: Should contain mqnic interrupt(s)

Optional properties:
- nvmem-cells: Phandle of nvmem cell containing the base MAC address
- nvmem-cell-names: Should be "mac-address"
- mac-address-increment-byte:
	Index of base MAC address byte to increment (default: 0x5)
- mac-address-increment:
	Number to add to the chosen base MAC address byte (default: 0x0)
- mac-address-local:
	Boolean, mark derived MAC addresses as "locally administrated"
	(default: false)
- module-eeproms: Array of phandles to SFP module EEPROM node(s)

Examples:

	mqnic0: ethernet@a0000000 {
		compatible = "corundum,mqnic";
		reg = <0x0 0xa0000000 0x0 0x1000000>,
		      <0x0 0xb0000000 0x0 0x1000000>;
		reg-names = "csr", "app";
		interrupt-parent = <&gic>;
		interrupts = <0x0 0x59 0x1>, <0x0 0x5a 0x1>, <0x0 0x5b 0x1>,
			     <0x0 0x5c 0x1>;

		nvmem-cells = <&macaddress>;
		nvmem-cell-names = "mac-address";

		mac-address-increment = <0x1>;
		mac-address-local;

		module-eeproms = <&module_eeprom_sfp0>, <&module_eeprom_sfp1>;
	};

	&eeprom {
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <1>;

		macaddress: macaddress@20 {
			reg = <0x20 0x06>;
		};
	};
