	help
	  A framer is a component in charge of an E1/T1 line interface.
	  Connected usually to a TDM bus, it converts TDM frames to/from E1/T1
	  frames. It also provides information related to the E1/T1 line.
	  Used with HDLC, the network can be reached through the E1/T1 line.

	  This framework is designed to provide a generic interface for framer
	  devices present in the kernel. This layer will have the generic
	  API by which framer drivers can create framer using the framer
	  framework and framer users can obtain reference to the framer.
	  All the users of this framework should select this config.

	  Enable support for the Lantiq PEF2256 (FALC56) framer.
	  The PEF2256 is a framer and line interface between analog E1/T1/J1
	  line and a digital PCM bus.

	  If unsure, say N.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called framer-pef2256.
