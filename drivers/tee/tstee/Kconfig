	  The Trusted Services project provides a framework for developing and
	  deploying device Root of Trust services in FF-A Secure Partitions.
	  This driver provides an interface to make Trusted Services Secure
	  Partitions accessible for user space clients, since the FF-A driver
	  doesn't implement a user space interface directly.
