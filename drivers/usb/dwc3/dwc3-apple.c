/*
 * This platform requires a very specific sequence of operations to bring up dwc3 and its USB3 PHY:
 *
 * 1) The PHY itself has to be brought up; for this we need to know the mode (USB3,
 *    USB3+DisplayPort, USB4, etc) and the lane orientation. This happens through typec_mux_set.
 * 2) DWC3 has to be brought up but we must not touch the gadget area or start xhci yet.
 * 3) The PHY bring-up has to be finalized and dwc3's PIPE interface has to be switched to the
 *    USB3 PHY, this is done inside phy_set_mode.
 * 4) We can now initialize xhci or gadget mode.
 *
 * We can switch 1 and 2 but 3 has to happen after (1 and 2) and 4 has to happen after 3.
 *
 * And then to bring this all down again:
 *
 * 1) DWC3 has to exit host or gadget mode and must no longer touch those registers
 * 2) The PHY has to switch dwc3's PIPE interface back to the dummy backend
 * 3) The PHY itself can be shut down, this happens from typec_mux_set
 *
 * We also can't transition the PHY from one mode to another while dwc3 is up and running (this is
 * slightly wrong, some transitions are possible, others aren't but because we have no documentation
 * for this I'd rather play it safe).
 *
 * After both the PHY and dwc3 are initialized we will only ever see a single "new device connected"
 * event. If we just keep them running only the first device plugged in will ever work. XHCI's port
 * status register actually does show the correct state but no interrupt ever comes in. In gadget
 * mode we don't even get a USBDisconnected event and everything looks like there's still something
 * connected on the other end.
 * This can be partially explained because the USB2 D+/D- lines are connected through a stateful
 * eUSB2 repeater which in turn is controlled by a variant of the TI TPS6598x USB PD chip which
 * resets the repeater out-of-band everytime the CC lines are (dis)connected. This then requires a
 * PHY reset to make sure the PHY and the eUSB2 repeater state are synchronized again.
 *
 * And to make this all extra fun: If we get the order of some of this wrong either the port is just
 * broken until a phy+dwc3 reset, or it's broken until a full SoC reset (likely because we can't
 * reset some parts of the PHY), or some watchdog kicks in after a few seconds and forces a full SoC
 * reset (mostly seen this with USB4/Thunderbolt but there's clearly some watchdog that hates
 * invalid states).
 *
 * Hence there's really no good way to keep dwc3 fully up and running after we disconnect a cable
 * because then we can't shut down the PHY anymore. And if we kept the PHY running in whatever mode
 * it was until the next cable is connected we'd need to tear it all down and bring it back up again
 * anyway to detect and use the next device.
 *
 * Instead, we just shut down everything when a cable is disconnected and transition to
 * DWC3_APPLE_NO_CABLE.
 * During initial probe we don't have any information about the connected cable and can't bring up
 * the PHY properly and thus also can't fully bring up dwc3. Instead, we just keep everything off
 * and defer the first dwc3 probe until we get the first cable connected event. Until then we stay
 * in DWC3_APPLE_PROBE_PENDING.
 * Once a cable is connected we then keep track of the controller mode here by transitioning to
 * DWC3_APPLE_HOST or DWC3_APPLE_DEVICE.
