          This provides support for exposing VIRTIO NET VF devices which support
          legacy IO access, using the VFIO framework that can work with a legacy
          virtio driver in the guest.
          Based on PCIe spec, VFs do not support I/O Space.
          As of that this driver emulates I/O BAR in software to let a VF be
          seen as a transitional device by its users and let it work with
          a legacy driver.

          If you don't know what to do here, say N.
