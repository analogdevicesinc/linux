	 * Drivers typically issue a reset to recover from GPU hangs.
	 * This procedure looks very different depending on whether a firmware
	 * or a hardware scheduler is being used.
	 *
	 * For a FIRMWARE SCHEDULER, each ring has one scheduler, and each
	 * scheduler has one entity. Hence, the steps taken typically look as
	 * follows:
	 *
	 * 1. Stop the scheduler using drm_sched_stop(). This will pause the
	 *    scheduler workqueues and cancel the timeout work, guaranteeing
	 *    that nothing is queued while the ring is being removed.
	 * 2. Remove the ring. The firmware will make sure that the
	 *    corresponding parts of the hardware are resetted, and that other
	 *    rings are not impacted.
	 * 3. Kill the entity and the associated scheduler.
	 *
	 *
	 * For a HARDWARE SCHEDULER, a scheduler instance schedules jobs from
	 * one or more entities to one ring. This implies that all entities
	 * associated with the affected scheduler cannot be torn down, because
	 * this would effectively also affect innocent userspace processes which
	 * did not submit faulty jobs (for example).
	 *
	 * Consequently, the procedure to recover with a hardware scheduler
	 * should look like this:
	 *
	 * 1. Stop all schedulers impacted by the reset using drm_sched_stop().
	 * 2. Kill the entity the faulty job stems from.
	 * 3. Issue a GPU reset on all faulty rings (driver-specific).
	 * 4. Re-submit jobs on all schedulers impacted by re-submitting them to
	 *    the entities which are still alive.
	 * 5. Restart all schedulers that were stopped in step #1 using
	 *    drm_sched_start().
	 *
	 * Note that some GPUs have distinct hardware queues but need to reset
	 * the GPU globally, which requires extra synchronization between the
	 * timeout handlers of different schedulers. One way to achieve this
	 * synchronization is to create an ordered workqueue (using
	 * alloc_ordered_workqueue()) at the driver level, and pass this queue
	 * as drm_sched_init()'s @timeout_wq parameter. This will guarantee
