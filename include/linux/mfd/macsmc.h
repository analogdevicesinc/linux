/**
 * typedef smc_key - Alias for u32 to be used for SMC keys
 *
 * SMC keys are 32bit integers containing packed ASCII characters in natural
 * integer order, i.e. 0xAABBCCDD, which represent the FourCC ABCD.
 * The SMC driver is designed with this assumption and ensures the right
 * endianness is used when these are stored to memory and sent to or received
 * from the actual SMC firmware (which can be done in either shared memory or
 * as 64bit mailbox message on Apple Silicon).
 * Internally, SMC stores these keys in a table sorted lexicographically and
 * allows resolving an index into this table to the corresponding SMC key.
 * Thus, storing keys as u32 is very convenient as it allows to e.g. use
 * normal comparison operators which directly map to the natural order used
 * by SMC firmware.
 *
 * This simple type alias is introduced to allow easy recognition of SMC key
 * variables and arguments.
