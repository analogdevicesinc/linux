 * mali_kbase_kinstr_jm_reader.h
 * Provides an ioctl API to read kernel atom state changes. The flow of the
 * API is:
 *    1. Obtain the file descriptor with ``KBASE_IOCTL_KINSTR_JM_FD``
 *    2. Determine the buffer structure layout via the above ioctl's returned
 *       size and version fields in ``struct kbase_kinstr_jm_fd_out``
 *    4. Poll the file descriptor for ``POLLIN``
 *    5. Get data with read() on the fd
 *    6. Use the structure version to understand how to read the data from the
 *       buffer
 *    7. Repeat 4-6
 *    8. Close the file descriptor
