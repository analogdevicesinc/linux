/*
 * The timer wheel has LVL_DEPTH array levels. Each level provides an array of
 * LVL_SIZE buckets. Each level is driven by its own clock and therefore each
 * level has a different granularity.
 *
 * The level granularity is:		LVL_CLK_DIV ^ level
 * The level clock frequency is:	HZ / (LVL_CLK_DIV ^ level)
 *
 * The array level of a newly armed timer depends on the relative expiry
 * time. The farther the expiry time is away the higher the array level and
 * therefore the granularity becomes.
 *
 * Contrary to the original timer wheel implementation, which aims for 'exact'
 * expiry of the timers, this implementation removes the need for recascading
 * the timers into the lower array levels. The previous 'classic' timer wheel
 * implementation of the kernel already violated the 'exact' expiry by adding
 * slack to the expiry time to provide batched expiration. The granularity
 * levels provide implicit batching.
 *
 * This is an optimization of the original timer wheel implementation for the
 * majority of the timer wheel use cases: timeouts. The vast majority of
 * timeout timers (networking, disk I/O ...) are canceled before expiry. If
 * the timeout expires it indicates that normal operation is disturbed, so it
 * does not matter much whether the timeout comes with a slight delay.
 *
 * The only exception to this are networking timers with a small expiry
 * time. They rely on the granularity. Those fit into the first wheel level,
 * which has HZ granularity.
 *
 * We don't have cascading anymore. timers with a expiry time above the
 * capacity of the last wheel level are force expired at the maximum timeout
 * value of the last wheel level. From data sampling we know that the maximum
 * value observed is 5 days (network connection tracking), so this should not
 * be an issue.
 *
 * The currently chosen array constants values are a good compromise between
 * array size and granularity.
 *
 * This results in the following granularity and range levels:
 *
 * HZ 1000 steps
 * Level Offset  Granularity            Range

 * struct timer_base - Per CPU timer base (number of base depends on config)
 * @lock:		Lock protecting the timer_base
 * @running_timer:	When expiring timers, the lock is dropped. To make
 *			sure not to race against deleting/modifying a
 *			currently running timer, the pointer is set to the
 *			timer, which expires at the moment. If no timer is
 *			running, the pointer is NULL.
 * @expiry_lock:	PREEMPT_RT only: Lock is taken in softirq around
 *			timer expiry callback execution and when trying to
 *			delete a running timer and it wasn't successful in
 *			the first glance. It prevents priority inversion
 *			when callback was preempted on a remote CPU and a
 *			caller tries to delete the running timer. It also
 *			prevents a life lock, when the task which tries to
 *			delete a timer preempted the softirq thread which
 *			is running the timer callback function.
 * @timer_waiters:	PREEMPT_RT only: Tells, if there is a waiter
 *			waiting for the end of the timer callback function
 *			execution.
 * @clk:		clock of the timer base; is updated before enqueue
 *			of a timer; during expiry, it is 1 offset ahead of
 *			jiffies to avoid endless requeuing to current
 *			jiffies
 * @next_expiry:	expiry value of the first timer; it is updated when
 *			finding the next timer and during enqueue; the
 *			value is not valid, when next_expiry_recalc is set
 * @cpu:		Number of CPU the timer base belongs to
 * @next_expiry_recalc: States, whether a recalculation of next_expiry is
 *			required. Value is set true, when a timer was
 *			deleted.
 * @is_idle:		Is set, when timer_base is idle. It is triggered by NOHZ
 *			code. This state is only used in standard
 *			base. Deferrable timers, which are enqueued remotely
 *			never wake up an idle CPU. So no matter of supporting it
 *			for this base.
 * @timers_pending:	Is set, when a timer is pending in the base. It is only
 *			reliable when next_expiry_recalc is not set.
 * @pending_map:	bitmap of the timer wheel; each bit reflects a
 *			bucket of the wheel. When a bit is set, at least a
 *			single timer is enqueued in the related bucket.
 * @vectors:		Array of lists; Each array member reflects a bucket
 *			of the timer wheel. The list contains all timers
 *			which are enqueued into a specific bucket.
