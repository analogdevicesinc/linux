# This file exists solely to be include in Kconfig.adi
# Unfortunately, this is the best approach to build all ADI codecs
# in a single change, since all that's needed is to imply the
# 'SND_SOC_ALL_ADI_CODECS' symbol and all should work
# It's not likely that this will be upstreamed soon, but the
# way it is now, the change is manage-able over time when merging
# upstream code in ADI linux tree
