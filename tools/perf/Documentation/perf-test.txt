perf-test(1)
============

NAME
----
perf-test - Runs sanity tests.

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'perf test [<options>] [{list <test-name-fragment>|[<test-name-fragments>|<test-numbers>]}]'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
This command does assorted sanity tests, initially through linked routines but
also will look for a directory with more tests in the form of scripts.

To get a list of available tests use 'perf test list', specifying a test name
fragment will show all tests that have it.

To run just specific tests, inform test name fragments or the numbers obtained
from 'perf test list'.

OPTIONS
-------
-s::
--skip::
	Tests to skip (comma separated numeric list).

-v::
--verbose::
	Be more verbose.

-S::
--sequential::
	Run tests one after the other, this is the default mode.

-p:: 
--parallel::
	Run tests in parallel, speeds up the whole process but is not safe with
	the current infrastructure, where some tests that compete for some resources,
	for instance, 'perf probe' tests that add/remove probes or clean all probes, etc.

-F::
--dont-fork::
	Do not fork child for each test, run all tests within single process, this
	sets sequential mode.

--dso::
	Specify a DSO for the "Symbols" test.
