This includes when packets are passing by and when packets are being sunk, but does not include when packets are being sent from  the ring stop.We really have two rings -- a clockwise ring and a counter-clockwise ring.  On the left side of the ring, the UP direction is on the clockwise ring and DN is on the counter-clockwise ring.  On the right side of the ring, this is reversed.  The first half of the CBos are on the left side of the ring, and the 2nd half are on the right side of the ring.  In other words (for example), in a 4c part, Cbo 0 UP AD is NOT the same ring as CBo 2 UP AD because they are on opposite sides of the ring.",
